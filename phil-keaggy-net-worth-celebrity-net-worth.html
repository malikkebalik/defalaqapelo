Phil Keaggy has released more than 50 albums in both contemporary Christian music and mainstream markets. He is a seven-time winner of the GMA Dove Award for Instrumental Album of the Year and was twice nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album. He has frequently been listed as one of the world's top-three "finger-style", as well as "finger-picking", guitarists by Guitar Player Magazine readers' polls.</p><h2 id=early-life-musical-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Musical Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Philip Tyler Keaggy was born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio, the ninth of ten children. His love for music was apparent from a young age; he received his first guitar on his tenth birthday and quickly developed an affinity for the instrument. Tragically, at the age of four, Keaggy lost the middle finger of his right hand in a water pump accident, but this did not deter him from becoming a guitar virtuoso.</p><h2 id=formation-glass-harp><strong>Formation of Glass Harp</strong></h2><p>In 1968, at the age of 17, Keaggy formed the band Glass Harp with childhood friends Daniel Pecchio and John Sferra. The progressive rock trio quickly gained a following in the Ohio area, leading to a contract with Decca Records in 1970. Glass Harp released three albums, including their self-titled debut, and opened for major acts like The Kinks and Yes.</p><h2 id=conversion-solo-career><strong>Conversion and Solo Career</strong></h2><p>A profound transformation in Keaggy's life and career occurred after his mother's death in a car accident in 1970, which led to his conversion to Christianity. He left Glass Harp in 1972 to pursue a solo career in contemporary Christian music, releasing his debut solo album, "What a Day," in 1973. Keaggy's faith became a prominent theme in his music, and he soon became a major figure in the Christian music industry.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-179405 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GettyImages-129501557.jpg alt="Phil Keaggy" width=439 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-179405 class=wp-caption-text>Rick Diamond/Getty Images</p><h2 id=musical-success-recognition><strong>Musical Success and Recognition</strong></h2><p>Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Keaggy released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including "Love Broke Thru," "The Master and the Musician," and "Sunday's Child." His virtuosic guitar playing and heartfelt songwriting resonated with audiences, earning him a dedicated following.</p><p>Keaggy's work has garnered him seven Dove Awards and multiple Grammy nominations. In 2007, he was inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame.</p><h2 id=collaborations-later-work><strong>Collaborations and Later Work</strong></h2><p>Throughout his career, Keaggy has collaborated with a range of artists across various genres, including Randy Stonehill, Russ Taff, and 2nd Chapter of Acts. His willingness to explore different styles and sounds has kept his music fresh and relevant, earning him respect across the Christian and mainstream music industries.</p><p>Even into the 2020s, Keaggy continues to write, record, and perform, exhibiting the same passion and dedication that marked his early career. His later albums, such as "The Cover of Love" and "All at Once," have been well-received, showcasing his enduring talent and creativity.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Keaggy is married to Bernadette, and they have a daughter, Alicia.
