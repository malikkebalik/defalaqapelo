Documents surfaced in Dec. 2020 referencing that the child was “formerly diagnosed with FAS due to Kathryn’s excessive drug and alcohol consumption while he was in utero,” <a href=#>The Sun</a> reports. Adding, that their son required “speech and occupational therapy for years to help combat his delays, but he is still falling behind at school.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Southern-Charm.jpg><h2 id=h-thomas-ravenel-alledges-kathryn-dennis-was-recently-using-drugs>Thomas Ravenel alledges Kathryn Dennis was recently using drugs</h2><p id=par-3_31>Ravenel also shared that Dennis did not actively participate in Saint’s therapy. He referenced a folder of worksheets Saint was supposed to complete with Dennis, which has “never been touched.”</p><p id=par-4_47>The custody battle has been going on for years, with the latest fight sparked in Oct. The couple previously shared joint custody of the children after Dennis lost custody because of drug use. She went to rehab and the former couple finally settled on joint custody.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_60>However, Ravenel cited that Dennis was no longer sober. He noted there were “changes” affecting the “health, safety and welfare” of the children,” <a href=#>The Sun</a> reported in Oct. Ravenel believed Dennis “relapsed and is no longer sober from illegal drugs.” He also alleged that Dennis was using cocaine. Plus she left the illegal drug in reach of the children.</p><h2 id=h-kathryn-dennis-revealed-she-was-drinking-alcohol-again-in-2019>Kathryn Dennis revealed she was drinking alcohol again in 2019</h2><p id=par-6_67>Dennis surprised viewers and some cast members when she shared that she was drinking alcohol again. She initially admitted she drank alcohol after her 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen was called into question. Fans wondered if Dennis was intoxicated, but she later insisted she was simply nervous. But she said she could drink alcohol during the Southern Charm Season 6 reunion.</p><p id=par-7_56>While Dennis didn’t drink alcohol on camera during season 6, she did during season 7. Craig Conover and Dennis met for lunch during the season 7 opener and she ordered a cocktail. Dennis asserted she wasn’t drinking to excess and Austen Kroll said he was glad her alcohol consumption was no longer being covered up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_47>“I am so sick and tired of this, like, you know, I don’t drink narrative,” he told <a href=#>US Weekly</a>. “As soon as, like, you know, she came out of the gates and she was like, ‘I’m drinking again,’ I was, like, ‘Yes.’ You know, like, ‘Good.’”</p><p id=par-9_58>“I don’t care to talk about this with someone, you know, off-camera,” he continued. “So, I think that she, you know, faced [it] kind of head-on and what that does is it prevents other people from talking about it, you know, behind [your] back.” But then he added, he hoped “it doesn’t turn out to be a problem.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAsMHToZyrpl2YtaK%2BzKxkpJmknb%2B6uoydnKemmah6rbvSrWScraOpvKXFjJyfoqSUp7KvedOhpqaZo2K%2FosLEp5ylZaedxm%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spider-man-no-way-home-star-reveals-how-pointing-meme-scene-happened.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Spider-Man: No Way Home star reveals how pointing meme scene happened</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-o-reilly-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert O'Reilly Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
