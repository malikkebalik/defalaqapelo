Lindsay’s outrageous behavior at the party was so disturbing to Anne that she told her daughter and Lindsay that she did not approve of their relationship and that Lindsay was not welcome in her home. Anne spoke on the record to the Daily Mail to promote her new jewelry line, and she didn’t mince words, calling Lindsay “psychotic,” “out of control” and “spoiling for a fight.”</p><p>Anne is the ex wife of Mick Jones, the guitar player of Foreigner. She has two children from that marriage, which was her second. Her first husband is a band manager named Laurence Ronson, with whom she had daughter Samatha, fashion designer Charlotte Ronson and music producer Mark Ronson. Here’s more of her quotes to the Daily Mail:</p><p>The lavish VIP after-party to mark the opening of Dubai’s latest luxury hotel, The Atlantis, was in full swing in the seven-room suite reserved for talk-show billionaire Oprah Winfrey.<br>As celebrity guests, including Kylie Minogue, actress Mischa Barton and designers Mary-Kate Olsen and Matthew Williamson, drank premium champagne and nibbled artfully created canapes, Ann Dexter-Jones watched in disbelief as actress Lindsay Lohan threw an extraordinary, childish tantrum.</p><p>It was the moment she knew that she had to intervene in her daughter Samantha Ronson’s romance with the troubled Hollywood star.</p><p>Lohan had been dating Samantha – Ann’s eldest daughter and a successful British DJ – who was playing at the 1,539-room resort’s grand opening celebration.</p><p>‘Suddenly, without any warning, Lindsay flung herself on to the thick carpet and started to roll around screaming like a child,’ said Ann, as she recalled the bizarre scene that so shocked her four years ago.</p><p>‘It seemed she was upset that people, including Samantha, were not paying her enough attention.</p><p>‘To my mind, it was classic psychotic behaviour. I took Lindsay aside and told her not to make a spectacle of herself. She was clearly out of control and spoiling for a fight.’</p><p>Even before the Dubai incident, Ann, the British-born former wife of guitarist Mick Jones from rock band Foreigner, was apprehensive about Samantha’s involvement with Lohan.</p><p>She said: ‘I know stuff, but I don’t want to go into it. I just knew that it was not a good place for my child to be, but sometimes a parent’s objection only makes it more exciting.</p><p>‘When I saw for myself just how volatile Lohan was, I realised that the relationship was not healthy.</p><p>‘The morning after her tantrum – and believe me, that was not the worst of it – I told them both that I could no longer support them as a couple, that I no longer approved of them being together and that Lindsay was no longer welcome in my home…’</p><p>‘I saw how much pain my daughter was in and that she was suffering deeply. She is a very Zen person and not used to the kind of turmoil that Lindsay seems to thrive on.</p><p>‘I was seriously anxious about Samantha’s safety and wellbeing. I feared a tragedy. It got to a point that I wasn’t sleeping very well.’</p><p>‘I didn’t want to interfere because I brought up my children to be strong and independent people from a very early age.</p><p>‘But after the incident in Dubai I knew it was time for me to take a stand and not act as an enabler. I’m a pretty blunt person and like to shoot from the hip, so to speak. So, I told them straight – to their faces. I said I didn’t want to create a social veneer; pretending everything was fine when it clearly wasn’t.</p><p>‘Naturally, Samantha did not take it very well, but as a parent I’ve never tried to win any popularity contest with my kids.’</p><p>Ann is the first to admit that in her day she was something of a wild child herself. ‘I was certainly no angel and, back in my time, I’d be rolling home from some nightclub or other just when the nanny was getting the kids ready for school.’</p><p>Even now, in her early 60s, she’s a feisty socialiser. She can still be found partying with the likes of P Diddy and Jay-Z, or hanging out with fashion designer Nicole Richie.</p><p>And after bringing up five children from two marriages, Ann is now making a name for herself as a jewellery designer. ‘It’s time to follow my own dreams,’ she said. ‘It is something I’ve wanted to do for a while, but only now have been able to find the time.’</p><p><a href=#>[From The Daily Mail]</a></p><p>There is little to compare between this lady and Dina Lohan. Anne is telling her kids that she doesn’t approve of their choices, and she’s putting her foot down – she’s not enabling them. It does strike me that she’s calling Samantha a “child,” though, and treating her like one, similar to how Dina infantilizes Lindsay. Samantha was certainly acting like one by dating that fool of an addict, but Dina doesn’t ever call her kids out on their sh*t like this. At least Anne didn’t ignore it, and let her daughter know exactly how she felt about Lohan.</p><p>How embarrassing to be at a big party like that and have to endure your daughter’s date flailing like a toddler on the floor. That’s out of control even for Lohan. Would she dare do that when she’s working as a paid escort or does she realize that she needs to act like a “professional” when she’s getting paid for her company?</p><p>Header photo is from 2-10-12.
