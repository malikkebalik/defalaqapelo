Their first Grand Slam defeat came in an 8-8 draw in France. Price was a member of the 1965 team that won the Triple Crown.</p><p>For a man from Deri near Bargoed who joined Newport in 1960, Price’s victory over Wilson Whineray’s famed touring All Blacks in 1963–64 was the highlight of his domestic exploits, if the 1969 crown was the high point of his international career.</p><p>“Devastated to hear that Brian Price passed away today. A great Newport, Wales and British Lions forward, I had the pleasure of sharing commentary with him on many occasions and he was a joy to work with. He was also a great colleague and friend.
