Swift moved from Pennsylvania to Tennessee in high school, but she’s always kept her home state close to her heart. And now, her childhood home belongs to a new owner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Taylor-Swift.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-has-written-about-her-childhood-home>Taylor Swift has written about her childhood home</h2><p id=par-2_47>In her early years, Taylor Swift grew up on a Christmas tree farm in Reading, Pennsylvania. She’s written songs about growing up on Pine Ridge Farm, including “Christmas Tree Farm,” “Seven,” and “The Best Day.” But the Swifts later relocated to a home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania.</p><p id=par-3_37>The Swifts purchased the house in Wyomissing in 1997 for $280,000, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Realtor.com</a>. The Georgian Colonial-style home was built in 1929 and has several charming details including brick fireplaces, a butler’s pantry, and crown molding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Swift didn’t have any friends when she moved to her childhood home</h2><p id=par-4_17>Swift recounted her experience growing up in Wyomissing in a 2008 interview with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reading Eagle</a>.</p><p id=par-5_21>“I didn’t have friends,” she said. “No one talked to me … When I moved to Wyomissing, I didn’t know anybody.”</p><p id=par-6_62>“When I was 9 or 10, I used to get all the lead roles [in school plays] because I was the tallest person,” she continued. “But my interest in music soon drew me to country music. I was infatuated with the sound, with the storytelling. I could relate to it. I can’t really tell you why. With me, it was just instinctual.”</p><p id=par-7_18>The family left Pennsylvania and moved to Nashville in 2004 so Swift could pursue her music career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Swift’s childhood home sold for $1 million</h2><p id=par-8_27>In February 2022, Swift’s house in Wyomissing hit the market for $1.1 million. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a> reported that it sold in April 2022 for $999,900.</p><p id=par-9_65>The house has changed hands a few times in the years since the Swift family left nearly two decades ago. And even though they left that house behind, Swift herself left a piece of herself in it: according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Philly Voice</a>, after the home was purchased, a note was found during renovations that the “Shake It Off” singer wrote about a trip to Disney World.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Swift’s homes today</h2><p id=par-10_44>Of course, Swift has become a successful musician in the years since she first moved to Nashville. Her net worth is estimated at approximately $365 million in 2022, and her autonomy over her legacy is growing as she continues <a href=#>re-recording her first six albums</a>.</p><p id=par-11_47>With a sizable personal fortune today, it’s no surprise that Swift has not one, but a few homes to her name. She maintains a residence in Nashville as well as <a href=#>several properties in New York</a>. She also has <a href=#>homes in Los Angeles</a> and Westerly, Rhode Island.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBosXLqKlmq6ees7W%2FjJyfoqSUnbywsIyhpqadXZ%2FCtMCMrKalnF1meq61y6WgqKZencGuuI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tonny-trindade-de-vilhena-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tonny Trindade de Vilhena Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pierre-bouvier-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pierre Bouvier Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
