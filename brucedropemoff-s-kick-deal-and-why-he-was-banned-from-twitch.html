Of course, this comes after numerous bans on his account. The reason for the most recent ban is not currently known, although it could be due to his use of the N-word during one particular stream. This marks the streamer’s fourth ban from the platform in total.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-bruce-has-had-to-deal-with-multiple-bans data-injectable=false>Bruce has had to deal with multiple bans</h2><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>The drama with Bruce began at the start of this year, after he exited his partnership with the gaming content organization One True King in January. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Since then, he’s spoken out against his former partners on Twitch numerous times</a>. He called out OTK’s co-founder Mizkif, after an alleged sexual assault cover-up. His feud with his former organization led to a lot of drama and ultimately the situation that he finds himself in now.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Evidently, the content creator has had enough of the Twitch bans. The platform is known for being incredibly harsh when dealing with streamers who break company policies. This approach has driven away numerous well known creators on the site such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amouranth</a>, who have gone on to greener pastures so to speak.</p><h2 id=h-details-regarding-his-new-deal data-injectable=false>Details regarding his new deal</h2><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>And now it seems Bruce is the latest name to join them as he confirmed via his YouTube channel on the 31st of May that he would be leaving Twitch and that he had signed a deal with Kick. In the video posted to his channel, titled “A New Dawn,” we see him traveling an icy tundra before following a neon sign that reads “Kick.” He’s transported to a new location where Adin Ross greets him before the video ends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The alternative platform is relatively new</a>, but it is aggressively pursuing any and all twitch streamers in order to grow an audience. Overall, it seems a lot more friendly towards its own content creators, firstly, the site is a lot less restrictive in terms of the content it allows users to create. But perhaps one of the most attractive benefits to streaming on Kick is that it offers a 95/5 sub split, meaning that creators keep 95% of the profits from their subscribers and the platform only takes 5%. For context, Twitch takes 50% and it isn’t looking to back down on that split.</p><p data-characters=560 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=false>Naturally, Bruce’s deal is looking a lot better on Kick, however, the drawback is that he’ll have a much smaller audience. But perhaps not for long, as the platform is fast growing and it’s quickly becoming a better alternative to Twitch which has had a monopoly on the live streaming business for far too long. In fact, Kick just celebrated a pretty big milestone as the site now has over 5 million users. Maybe Bruce is ahead of the curve as Kick looks like it could seriously outplay his former streaming home with its more streamer-friendly approach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZomautk5qxs7vPnqSonpaoeqy1wqRknZ2RoXqiusNmrqGxXZ2ybsPArGSbmZ6jsqV5xaumpmWkrLa1r8do</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fran%C3%A7oise-hardy-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Franoise Hardy Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ayrton-senna-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ayrton Senna Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
