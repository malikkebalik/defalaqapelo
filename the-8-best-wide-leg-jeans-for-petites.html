That goes double for looser silhouettes which have a tendency to swallow a smaller frame — and the best wide-leg jeans for petites are especially few and far between. Since this style is just barely on its way back as <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>skinny jeans take a breather</a>, it’s rare to find brands that do it well in general, never mind for those who are 5 feet 4 inches or shorter. As a result, us short people typically have two options: We can find a pair that’s offered in a petite or short inseam (which isn’t common for <a href=# class=T3D>wide-leg jeans</a>, though they do exist), or we can opt for a cropped pair that’ll probably hit below the calf on our shorter legs (but they still shouldn’t require any hemming).</p><p>Once you figure out which route you want to go, the usual jeans-related online-shopping questions apply: Do they come in my size? How wide do I want the leg to be? Do I prefer <a href=# class=T3D>low-rise jeans</a> or high-waisted ones? What color am I looking for? Are these jeans highly reviewed (especially by other short people), since I won’t get a chance to try them on before I buy them?</p><p>If you’re short and looking for a good pair of wide-leg jeans that won’t run past your feet, these are your best options from Amazon and beyond. They come in a wide range of sizes, shades, and styles — and some even feature hundreds for five-star reviews.</p><h2>1. The Overall Best Wide-Leg Jeans For Petites</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amanda jeans from Gloria Vanderbilt</a> check all of the boxes for a petite-friendly wide-leg jean: First, they come in a large range of sizes, including petite inseams, so you can find a great fit. Second, they’re cropped, so they shouldn’t hit past your ankle. Third, their loose silhouette and lower rise ensure that they sit at the natural waist, even on shorter torsos. And finally, they’re highly reviewed with more than 700 five-star ratings, comfortable thanks to their stretch-denim construction, and come in a handful of colors.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 4 — 26 Plus (including petite inseams)</li><li>Available colors: Kent Whiskers, Vintage White, Parkes Whiskers, Bondi Whiskers, Madison, White, Robertson Indigo Wide Stripe, Mendocino</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “I like the fit they are still cropped even on my short frame. Looks good with flip flops flats or boots. Perfect rise not too high or low either. Nice heavy denim good for spring fall or winter. Petite win!”</p><h2>2. The Best Long Pants For Petites</h2><p>As previously discussed, many short people opt for cropped jeans that then hit at the ankle — but these <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lands’ End wide-ankle pants</a> are actually designed for an ankle-length fit on petite people. That’s because they come in petite size options with pre-hemmed inseams that are 25.5 inches long. The spandex-cotton-blend fabric is stretchy and comfortable, and depending on which color you choose, can look like jeans or slacks.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 2 — 26 Plus (including petite inseams)</li><li>Available colors: Deep Sea Navy, White, Washed Military Green, Dark Iron Gray, Walworth Blue, Ground Cumin</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “I always know clothes will fit when I order from Lands End. Quality is excellent.”</p><h2>3. The Best High-Rise Button Jeans</h2><p>These <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Goodthreads Coulotte jeans</a> have an overall rating of 4.4 stars after more than 600 reviewers have weighed in. They don’t come in petite sizes, but the 25.5-inch inseam works well for shorter frames. (Some reviewers have even cut them to their preferred length.) Customers also love the 11-inch high-rise waist with four stylish buttons, especially when combined with the wide legs and on-trend color options. Because these jeans are made from a cotton-polyester-elastane blend, they have a lived-in feel that’s super stretchy and still retains its shape in between washes.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 0 — 24</li><li>Available colors: Authentic Blue, Deep Blue, Light Destructed Wash, Bleach Wash</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “I love these!!! The material is stretchy and soft! So comfy! I wore them for three days when I first got them. For me, I am [pear shaped] and short 5’1 and I got one size up, and I love the way they fit.”</p><h2>4. The Best Straight Ankle Jeans</h2><p>If you’re looking for a looser jean that’s not too wide, opt for a straight-leg silhouette instead. These <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Levi’s Ribcage straight jeans</a> come in tons of sizes and colors, and while they’re not offered in short inseams, their cropped ankle silhouette has still gotten raves from petite reviewers — especially since they’re easy to cuff. They feature an extra-high rise, but are still “stretchy” and “comfy” thanks to their cotton-polyester-elastane blend. So far, they’ve racked up an overall 4.3-star rating after more than 3,500 reviews.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 24 — 44</li><li>Available colors: Summer Slide, Cosmic Chatter, Mind Your Own Finish, Fall Storm, Fall Trip, Space Ripple, Pick A Draw, Worn Out, Worse For Wear, Here Nor There</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “I love where they hit on my waist, because they are high but not too high. I'm only 5'3" with a short torso and they look great. They have just the right amount of stretch, so they are comfortable and do not stretch out after wearing.”</p><h2>5. A Wide-Leg Jean With Petite Inseams</h2><p>These <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Woman Within cotton jeans</a> come in dozens of sizes, including tall, regular, and petite inseams, and the petite inseam measures 29 inches for a length that, according to one reviewer, is “just perfect and did not require shortening.” The design also features a two-button closure and four functional pockets. Choose from a handful of colors.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 12 Plus — 38 Plus (including petite inseams)</li><li>Available colors: Black, Indigo, Natural Khaki, Light Stonewash, Medium Stonewash</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “These are for my daughter who is short and she loves the color and the fit... She ordered another pair in a lighter wash!”</p><h2>6. The Best Bootcut Jeans For Petites</h2><p>Most jeans that aren’t skinny jeans get grouped together as “wide leg” — but even bootcut styles are often too long if you’re petite. These <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lee bootcut jeans</a> are the exception. They sit at the mid-waist and come in two dark colors, but the real selling point is the fact that they come in petite inseams. As a result, according to reviewers, they offer the “perfect fit and length when wearing boots or shoes with some sort of heel.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 2 — 32 (including petite inseams)</li><li>Available colors: Black, Compass</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “These are perfect length. I'm struggling lately with finding jeans that are not too long. I tried petite and short. Everything was still 1-2" too long. I was about to give up hope but these are great.”</p><h2>7. These Comfortable Wide-Leg Jeans</h2><p>Since these <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lee cropped jeans</a> have a relaxed fit and are made from a blend of cotton, recycled polyester, rayon, and spandex, they’re some of the most comfortable jeans on this list. The material is soft, breathable, and moderately stretchy to move with you, while the cropped 26-inch inseam works well for shorter people. They also feature a number of classic accents for style, like an iconic Lee patch and stitching around the edges.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: 00 — 20</li><li>Available colors: Chalk, Washed Black, Watchet</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “These jeans are amazing. Soft, stretchy, and trendy. I am 5’4” 128lb with muscular thighs and have a hard time finding pants that fit in the waist AND the butt/legs. These are perfection, my new staple!”</p><h2>8. These Easy-To-Cut Bell Bottoms</h2><p>It’s nearly impossible to find well-reviewed bell-bottom jeans on Amazon that come in petite sizes. That said, these <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sidefeel flare jeans</a> are a viable option for short people if they’re willing to take a scissor to them — and according to petite reviewers, the results of this little DIY project are fantastic. Due to their distressed design, wide legs, and already-frayed hems on most styles, no one will notice that you removed a few inches of fabric. They’re also stretchy, comfortable, and available in a huge selection of colors and patterns, all of which explain their 15,000-plus reviews and cult-favorite status on Amazon.</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — 4X-Large</li><li>Available colors: Blue, Black, Brown, Dark Gray, Gray, Light Blue, White, Black With Flowers, Blue with Stars, Blue With Diamonds, Blue With Flowers, Black With Button, Blue With Button, Brown Corduroy, Brown Vertical Seams, Bluw WIth Sunflowers, Sky Blue With Button, Green, Orange, Blue With Sunflowers and Patches, Blue With American Flower, Paperbag, Blue With Camo Patches, Blue With Leopard Patches, Blue With Plaid Patches</li></ul><p><strong>One reviewer wrote</strong>: “I’m on the short side so I loved that I could cut several inches off and still had the look of bell bottoms!! I wear them every where and have gotten so many compliments on them. I love love love!!”</p><p>Other Wide-Leg Petite Jeans From Around The Web:</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmeSmsC1edaim55lnJq0brbEmqWsZZakv268xK2grZ2j</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trey-anastasio-s-net-worth-updated-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trey Anastasio's Net Worth (Updated 2024)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lucas-plans-a-big-surprise-bill-makes-a-decision.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lucas Plans a Big Surprise, Bill Makes a Decision</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
