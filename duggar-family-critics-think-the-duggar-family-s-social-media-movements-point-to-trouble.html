After two years of relative quiet and stability from the former reality TV stars, things are changing, and they are changing quickly. Several Duggar family members have changed <a href=#>their social media posting strategies</a>, and family followers feel certain that something sinister is behind the sudden changes. Joy-Anna Forsyth’s recent decision to step back from vlogging and Jana Duggar’s renewed interest in YouTube are highly suspicious, argue critics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joy-anna-forsyth-leaves-youtube-behind>Joy-Anna Forsyth leaves YouTube behind</h2><p id=par-2_39>When Counting On was canceled following Josh Duggar’s arrest for possessing and receiving child sexual abuse images, the Duggar family scattered. Some adult children left the spotlight behind completely, while others carved out revenue streams on Instagram and YouTube.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Joy-and-Austin-2.png><p id=par-3_61>Joy-Anna Forsyth was one of the few adult Duggars who opted to remain in the public eye. She’s run a successful YouTube channel with weekly uploads for the last couple of years. That is changing. In her most recent upload, Joy-Anna announced the end of <a href=#>her weekly vlogs</a>, insisting that her life had gotten too busy to sustain her upload schedule.</p><p id=par-4_37>She didn’t say she was leaving for good, but she did insist her approach to social media would be significantly different moving forward. The decision seemingly came out of nowhere, leaving followers concerned and a bit suspicious.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joy-anna-s-decision-to-step-back-isn-t-the-only-odd-thing-going-on-in-arkansas>Joy-Anna’s decision to step back isn’t the only odd thing going on in Arkansas</h2><p id=par-5_37>Joy-Anna’s announcement isn’t the only major change to the Duggar family’s social media strategy. While Joy is pulling away from the spotlight, her older sister is reentering it after years away from all forms of social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Joy-Anna-and-Jana-Duggar-siblings-1.jpg><p id=par-6_97>Just two days after Joy-Anna announced the end of her weekly vlogs, Jana Duggar popped up on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> for the first time in three years. Jana, seemingly out of nowhere, uploaded a lengthy video that shared life updates with her followers. She showed off her projects around the Duggar family compound and featured some of the family’s pets. While she didn’t offer anything all that groundbreaking in the way of news, Duggar family critics still find the timing of the video a bit suspicious. Why would Jana return to YouTube just days after Joy-Anna announced her departure?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duggar-family-critics-theorize-that-jim-bob-and-michelle-duggar-could-be-in-legal-trouble>Duggar family critics theorize that Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar could be in legal trouble</h2><p id=par-7_61>Joy-Anna’s departure from YouTube, Jana’s sudden interest in the platform, and <a href=#>Josh Duggar’s lost appeal </a>have fans thinking there is more behind the sudden social media movements than changed priorities. Some critics believe Jim Bob Duggar is behind the most recent movements. They strongly suspect Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar might be using their kids to deflect attention away from themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jim-Bob-and-Michelle-Duggar-IBLP.jpg><p id=par-8_108><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit </a>users took to the platform to discuss the recent changes to the family’s social media strategy. One fan suggested Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar may be trying to cover up an investigation, just as they did when the Department of Homeland Security nabbed Josh Duggar. Some followers believe the IRS might be looking into the couple after Jill Dillard spilled the beans on <a href=#>Jim Bob’s shady payroll practices</a>. Still, there is little concrete evidence to back up the theory. We do know that something is clearly going on in Tontitown, Arkansas. If it is anything serious, it’s only a matter of time before it comes to light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxtrPGmqlmnpGitq3FjJypoqyZmMBuwMeipaRlpJ2ybrDUoJ6aql2brq61y7KqZqufmLaiuIymnJ2hkWK6sMLEppynrKNivbC1za1kraddqb%2BwwcGlnGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-dunn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Dunn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-radcliffe-didn-t-want-to-work-with-rupert-grint-so-soon-after-harry-potter-ended.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Radcliffe Didnt Want to Work With Rupert Grint so Soon After Harry Potter Ended</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
