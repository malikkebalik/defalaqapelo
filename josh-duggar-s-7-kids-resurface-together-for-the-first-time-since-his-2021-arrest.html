The snapshot did little to dispel rumors that Anna Duggar is<a href=#> on the outs with the Duggar family.</a> Anna didn’t show up in a photo with her in-laws. Instead, she and her children appeared in a picture with the Keller family.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Anna Duggar and her seven children are seen for the first time in years&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_55>In the years since Josh Duggar’s arrest and eventual <a href=#>conviction on child pornography charges</a>, Anna was spotted sporadically in the background of Duggar videos. Her children also appeared occasionally in photos but never as a larger group. A recent photo posted by the Keller family is the first spot of the entire family since 2021.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/anna-duggar-TLC-interview-seven-kids.jpg><p id=par-3_87>In the image, uploaded to Priscilla and David Waller’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;account, Anna and her seven children are dressed in shades of blue and black and are seen smiling with the entire Keller family. Duggar family followers note that Anna looks relaxed and surprisingly content in the family photo, considering the occasion. According to the Instagram post, the family gathered to memorialize Anna’s grandfather. Since Josh’s arrest, she’s looked miserable every time she was caught in footage captured by the Duggars. Her kids look happy and surprisingly grown up, too.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When was the last family photo?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_61>Anna Duggar has been keeping a very low profile since Josh Duggar’s arrest in April 2021. She’s shied so far away from the spotlight that she even deleted her Instagram account. The decision to delete the account came many months after Josh was convicted of possessing and receiving child pornography, but she had left the profile mostly abandoned before that, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_71>Josh, Anna, and their children last appeared all together in a family photo just days before he turned himself in to federal marshals. The Instagram post was used to announce their <a href=#>seventh and seemingly final pregnancy.</a> Madyson Lily, the focus of the pregnancy announcement, turned two on Oct. 23. Madyson Lily appeared in just a single Instagram post to announce her birth before the account was abandoned and later shut down.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_29>Even in the newest family photo, followers aren’t getting a clear shot of the toddler’s face. Instead, Madyson is facing in the opposite direction while Anna holds her tightly.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-are-anna-duggar-s-kids-in-2023>How old are Anna Duggar’s kids in 2023?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_71>Anna is operating as a single parent now, and she certainly has her hands full. The mother of seven welcomed a new baby almost every two years since marrying the troubled eldest son of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. <a href=#>The couple’s oldest child</a>, Mackynzie Duggar, turned 14 early in October. She was followed by brothers Michael and Marcus Duggar in June 2011 and June 2013, respectively. They are 12 and 10.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-163513528.jpg><p id=par-8_73>In July 2015, just as Josh’s two original scandals were breaking, Anna was welcoming her fourth child, a daughter named Meredith. Mason Duggar joined the family in September 2017. They turned 8 and 6 years old this year. Maryella Duggar, named after the Duggar family patriarch, Mary Duggar, arrived in November 2019. She is set to turn four this year. The baby of the family, Madyson Lily, was quietly welcomed in late 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxtrPGmqlmnpGitq3FjKOmrKBdmcKos8CrqmZvXaC2pb%2BMq5ysraKbrqSxjK2moJ2knbKzecWoqWasmJp6p7XRrKtmrJmism6%2FyKeanmWYnsBufo9raGaZoqeytMCNoaumpF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-arteaga-wiki-bio-family-age-boyfriend-movies-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristin Arteaga: Wiki, Bio, Family, Age, Boyfriend, Movies, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-seinfeld-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Seinfeld Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
