When fans left&nbsp;Logan Huntzberger&nbsp;in season 7 , he was on a journey to become his own man. Sure, he was downtrodden by&nbsp;Rory Gilmore&nbsp;<a href=#>rejecting his proposal</a>. Regardless, he was moving full steam ahead with his plans to leave the Huntzberger family business.</p><p id=par-2_63>When fans caught back up with him in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Logan had seriously regressed. His regression was not unlike that of his college sweetheart, Rory. He was engaged to a French heiress and was working for the family business in London. Years after the revival, it remains unclear why Logan was with the faceless Odette in the first place.</p><h2 id=h-logan-huntzberger-s-regression-was-shocking>Logan Huntzberger’s regression was shocking</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_69>There were many shocking aspects of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Still, Logan’s regression is the most appalling part of all. His character regression was even more shocking than<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;the floundering and selfish Rory</a>&nbsp; in the revival. When Gilmore Girls originally ended, Rory was pretty obnoxious, so finding her as a rootless failure wasn’t a huge surprise. On the other hand, Logan appeared to be coming into his own.</p><p id=par-4_69>When fans caught up with the famed character in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2016 Netflix revival</a>, Logan was living in London. He was working for his father’s business with intention of taking over the day-to-day operations eventually. Logan, most shockingly, was engaged to a faceless heiress while carrying on an affair with his college girlfriend, who he was, very obviously, still in love with. It was, for lack of a better word, bizarre.</p><h2 id=h-why-was-logan-huntzberger-with-odette-in-gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life>Why was Logan Huntzberger with Odette in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_36>Aside from questioning who the father of Rory’s baby was, fans were left to wonder why Logan was with Odette in the first place when the credits rolled for&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.</p><p id=par-6_51>The answer to that is simple. Everything fans saw in season 7 of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;didn’t happen in Amy Sherman-Palladino’s mind.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She never watched the final season</a>, never saw Logan change and adapt. She never considered that 25-year-old Logan was markedly more mature and caring than the 24-year-old Logan she last wrote about.</p><p id=par-7_82>In short, Logan didn’t regress in Sherman-Palladino’s mind; he stayed the same. When Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino couldn’t agree with the network, they walked away from season 7 of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls. The pair never intended to continue the story in the revival. Instead, they picked up where they left off. Where they left things included Logan following&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Huntzberger family’s dynastic plan.</a>&nbsp;If you attack the revival from that angle, it makes sense that Logan would be engaged to someone his family found more fitting.</p><h2 id=h-could-a-second-gilmore-girls-revival-explain-logan-s-regression>Could a second&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;revival explain Logan’s regression?</h2><p id=par-8_69>While a second revival hasn’t been officially announced, there are reasons to believe that it could still happen. If it does, it seems possible that Logan’s regression would be further explained and explored. Even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans who didn’t like Logan and Rory</a>&nbsp;together can admit that the backstory could certainly be juicy. Is it possible that Sherman-Palladino wrote Logan’s character in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&nbsp;with a second revival in mind?</p><p id=par-9_27>Sherman-Palladino hasn’t said that exactly. Still, it’s easy to look at some of her words and ascertain that she always planned to return to Stars Hollow.</p><p id=par-10_56>In 2017, Sherman-Palladino signed a monster deal with Amazon to create content for their platform. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Times</a>, her hit&nbsp;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel endeared her to the studio so much that they were willing to include a&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;clause in her contract. That means if she wanted to return to Netflix to pen another revival, she could.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_82>The fact that Sherman-Palladino had the clause written into the contract in 2017 seems to indicate that she always intended to return. Sherman-Palladino has also made it clear that she has a bit of a soft spot for Logan’s character. It is hard to imagine she would do the character so dirty without any plans to redeem him later. So, it seems possible that the famed showrunner is simply playing the long game here. Maybe&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Logan</a>&nbsp;will come out on top, after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0qrjMqKmeZZeev62%2FjLCfsmWnlsBuuM6gmKdlmKq7tcbBnqmgnaJiuqK%2B0bKgp59dpLGmwNOeZJqmqayuunrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yuri-shatunov-biograf%C3%ADa-edad-altura-esposo-net-worth-familia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yuri Shatunov biografa, edad, altura, esposo, net worth, familia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miyavi-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miyavi Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
