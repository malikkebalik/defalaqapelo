The lifetime battle of a Chowchilla bus kidnapping survivor to keep her captors in jail.</strong></p><p>In Chowchilla, California, on July 15, 1976, 26 children between the ages of 5 and 14 were abducted, along with a school bus driver.</p><p>The kidnappers imprisoned their victims in a box truck buried in a quarry in Livermore, California, and demanded a ransom for their release.</p><p>This week’s episode of CBS 48 Hours will focus on the 1976 Chowchilla kidnapping of 26 students and the bus driver from a school bus.</p><p>When word spread on July 15 that 26 children and their bus driver had vanished while returning from summer camp, more than 500 people, or 10% of the total population of this small village, arrived to witness how the community reacted.</p><p>Three masked and highly armed kidnappers, Frederick Woods, James Schoenfeld, and Richard Schoenfeld, held them prisoner in an underground box truck in a rock quarry.</p><p>Also Read-<a href=# rel=noopener> Chowchilla Kidnapping: Larry Park, Andrea Park And Darla Daniels Remember The Ordeal</a></p><h2>Where Are Jeff And Jennifer Brown Now?</h2><p>Jennifer currently holds the positions of Executive assistant, wife, and mother. Her childhood was essentially over when she was abducted at nine years old.</p><p>When faced with a life-threatening situation, Hyde said on CNN in 2013: “You couldn’t just go on and enjoy a normal childhood. You’ll have to stop being carefree eventually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jennifer-Brown-now.jpg><p>She claimed she could not travel underground or by metro and slept with a nightlight. According to CBS, she recently overcame the want to keep the nightlight on as she sleeps.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is no denying the trauma caused by the event. Years later, when Jennifer discussed her experiences, she compared her feelings to those of an animal being led to the slaughterhouse.</p><p>She reportedly currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee, according to sources. Yet, because Jennifer keeps a shallow profile, little is known about her health.</p><p>It makes sense that she has tried to rebuild her life and overcome the terrible childhood event.</p><p>Though specific memories have persisted, Jennifer nevertheless finds it difficult to adjust to life like other people. Likewise, Jeff Brown must have suffered mentally from such an ordeal.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Chowchilla Kidnappers Arrest And Charges Explored</span></h2><p>In CBS’ “48 Hours,” the terrifying specifics of the 1976 Chowchilla kidnapping are revealed once more. On July 15, 1976, a van halted Ray’s bus while transporting students from Dairyland Elementary School.</p><p>Three men in masks, one holding a gun to Ray’s head while the other controlled the bus, stood in the way. The third arrived later in the vehicle. They hid the bus in Berenda Slough and crammed everyone into two vans.</p><p>The kidnappers drove for almost 11 hours before taking the driver and the kids to the quarry in Livermore. There was a buried moving truck there that was loaded down with food and mattresses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chowchilla-kidnapping.jpg><p>Along with the driver, the kids were loaded onto the vehicle. Because of it, they could stack the beds and climb to the truck’s roof. A metal sheet and industrial batteries weighed it down.</p><p>Ray and Michael Marshall, the oldest boy at the time and was 14 years old, opened the lid and let the storms out. Sixteen hours after being abducted, Ray and the kids made their way to the guard hut at the quarry to make their claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Chowchilla Kidnappers: Where Are James Schoenfeld And Richard Schoenfeld Now?
