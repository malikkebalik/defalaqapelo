She was also <a href=#>raised in an ultra-conservative family</a>. Olivia and Ethan met at a camp for conservative Christian families and married in 2018 when they were just 20 years old. But soon, Olivia began to distance herself from the lifestyle in which she was raised. That caused some serious tension with her in-laws and, eventually, her husband.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_21>Now, that Olivia and Ethan are divorced, some fans are wondering why she would continue to associate with the Plath family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_24>“Can’t believe you’re going to be back on that show with that crazy family,” one person commented on one of Olivia’s recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> posts.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_17>Olivia says she wants to be able to challenge the Plath’s conservative views on Welcome to Plathville.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_26>“Doing my own thing in my own way with my own people.
