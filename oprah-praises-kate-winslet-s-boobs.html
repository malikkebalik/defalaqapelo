And she always seems so natural when she’s naked on screen. She’s not afraid to look blotchy when she’s crying or to flash her cellulite. She owns her body, and even as she is beginning to age, she still has a beautiful and natural figure that’s hard to ignore. After winning two Golden Globes for best actress in The Reader and Revolutionary Road, Oprah complimented Kate on her natural breasts.</p><p>“I love the fact that you have real breasts, ’cause in all the breast scenes, your breasts do what real breasts do,” she said Tuesday on The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><p>“There’s that wonderful thing, you know, if you are a woman, you’re lying on your back, your breasts they go to – they part – but if you look at a woman with not real breasts, their breasts are sticking straight up,” she told the actress, who won two Golden Globes Sunday. “That’s how you know. God bless your real breasts!”</p><p>[from <a href=#>Us</a>]</p><p>When filming The Reader, Kate refused to use a body double and took a very healthy attitude to baring her body:</p><p>The British actress appears naked in her new film The Reader but refused to use a body double or lose weight for the scenes, wanting a completely realistic look for her character.</p><p>Describing her own body, Kate admits to having aged, but maintains she is proud of her flawed physique, saying: “Here we go, I have a crumble baby belly, boobs are worse for wear after two kids… I’m doing all right. I’m 33. I don’t look in the mirror and go, ‘Oh, I look fantastic!’ Of course I don’t.</p><p>“Nobody is perfect. I just don’t believe in perfection. But I do believe in saying, ‘This is who I am and look at me not being perfect!’ I’m proud of that.”</p><p>[from <a href=#>Sydney Morning Herald</a>]</p><p>Halle Berry also recently complimented Kate’s body, saying that she wishes she, too, had the guts to get naked on screen more often. Although it’s a bit hard to feel sorry for Halle Berry’s body issues, Kate does offer an alternative to the typical Hollywood look. After having children, most actresses choose to cover up for their roles, go crazy about losing their baby weight, and hire personal trainers. If the tabloids are to be believed, having a baby shouldn’t change your body and if you don’t get down to pre-baby weight immediately, it means that you’re just not trying hard enough. Kate not only speaks out about these standards, but practices what she preaches. It’s hard to imagine the movie industry becoming less body-conscious overnight, but as long as Kate is around, there’s at least one star who has a healthy attitude about weight and body image. Let’s hope she lets it all hang out more often.</p><p>Kate Winslet is shown on 1/11/09 at the Golden Globes with her husband, Sam Mendes, and co-star, Leonardi DiCaprio.
