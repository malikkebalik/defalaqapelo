A hard-nosed police chief, Kanisky sometimes struggled to relate to his daughters, particularly the two older ones, Katie and Julie.

After her death, Nell moved into the Kaniskys’ home to run the household and help look after the children.

Although he had missed four shows the previous season because of surgery, his character had been featured on the show less during the fourth season.</p><p id=par-6_50>Once the fifth season got underway, the show handled Sweet’s death by also having Kanisky die. The first show of the fifth season takes place three months after the Chief died.
