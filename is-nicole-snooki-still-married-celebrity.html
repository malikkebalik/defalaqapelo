Jionni and Nicole have stuck it out after enduring a ton of drama.</p><p>Jersey Shore’s Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi once again fueled divorce rumors in her latest Instagram post Credit: Instagram / Snooki Snooki decided to share three photos on the Instagram post, with each focusing on her kids: daughter Giovanna, seven, and sons Lorenzo, nine, and Angelo, two.</p><h2>Who is Snooki married to?</h2><p>Who Is Snooki Married To? Meet Her Husband<strong> Jionni LaValle</strong></p><p>Before the couple said “I do,” they welcomed their son Lorenzo in 2012. While the grade-schooler was in attendance at his parents’ wedding, Snooki had just given birth to their daughter, Giovanna, two months before her nuptials. They completed their family in May 2019 when they welcomed their youngest son, Angelo.</p><p>The East Hanover, New Jersey, native met Snooki in 2010 during a night out at infamous hotspot Karma, a.k.a. Seaside Heights’ fist-pumping headquarters. A source previously told Us Weekly that it took some time for the leopard print-loving reality star to catch feelings for Jionni. “She wasn’t sure about him at first,” an insider said at the time. “She was hesitant because he isn’t the typical gorilla. He’s pretty quiet.”</p><p>Jionni is a<strong> lifelong entrepreneur.</strong> While he previously helmed an ATM business and a T-shirt company called NJ Fatman, he now runs his own Etsy shop called LaValle’s Man Cave. There, he sells merchandise with different sayings about his all-time favorite hobby: golf.</p><p>The Confessions of a Guidette author broke up with Emilio in<strong> April 2010</strong> amid suspicions he was using her. “She is beyond furious at him,” a source told Radar Online at the time. “And she now believes that he was just using, and now abusing, her so he would get famous.”.</p><p><strong>Yes, after they got serious, Jionni had no other choice</strong> but to get comfortable in front of an ever-present camera crew. “Jionni doesn’t like the cameras,” Snooki has said. “ [But] in order to see me, he kind of has to suck it up.” Apparently, she’s changed that rule!</p><h2>How many kids does Nicole have?</h2><p>However, she later gave him a chance and then fell madly in love with him. The couple got married in 2014 and now have<strong> three</strong> kids together. Looking back on their relationship, fans are shocked that Nicole and Jionni’s relationship has lasted for so many years.</p><p>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi has been with Jionni LaValle for 11 years. Some Jersey Shore fans didn’t think that this couple would make it.

In fact, Nicole rarely posts photos alongside her husband. Jionni is perceived as being quite controlling in their relationship.</p><p>Not only did Jionni stick by Nicole’s side through her Italy antics, which the user described as a ” train wreck, ” he also stayed with Nicole after she allegedly slept with Vinny Guadagnino and Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino. Nicole had also supposedly been with one of Jionni’s cousins prior to them dating.</p><p><strong>Jionni is the only spouse that has not been seen on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.</strong> However, he supports his wife’s career.
