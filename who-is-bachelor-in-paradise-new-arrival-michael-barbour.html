Given that he was eliminated in episode 4 of The Bachelorette after forming a connection with Charity far too late in the competition, the 29-year-old is already having better luck on the beach, embarking on his first-ever one-on-one date just last night (November 16).</p><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Arriving with a date card, Michael chose to go on said one-on-one date with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Olivia Lewis</a>, who found herself to be a single woman after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Henry chose to pursue his relationship with Kat Izzo</a> instead, giving “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricane Kat</a>” a rose at the rose ceremony just hours prior to the arrival of the Illinois native. The “Paradise Gods” were truly looking out for Olivia by sending Michael down to Mexico, as she deemed the hot new bombshell to be “a gentleman” and&nbsp;“chivalrous,” as well as a “great Southern man” upon their initial conversation — how sweet is that?</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Getting some alone time away from the rest of the Bachelor In Paradise contestants, Michael and Olivia’s date was a barrel of fun, consisting of loads and loads of dancing, as well as a smooch or two. Based on the looks of things, this pair might just be a match made in Paradise…</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Nonetheless, to learn who Michael is beyond his Bachelor In Paradise journey, just keep scrolling — he is so much more than meets the eye!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Michael-Barbour-1.png><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>As mentioned, Michael is a 29-year-old from South Holland, Illinois, and he is ready to set sail on his journey for love for the second time (no pun intended).</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>According to his official bio for The Bachelorette, “This yacht captain considers himself a romantic who puts time into the little things, often showering his partner with sentimental gifts. He believes if a woman feels safe and taken care of, the energy will be reciprocated tenfold. Although he grew up an only child, this Chicago-based charmer is also very family oriented and wants to have a big family someday. When he’s not working on his yacht, he’s spending time with his beloved grandfather in the off season.”</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Based on his Instagram profile, there is even more to Michael than his official bio for The Bachelorette gives him credit for, revealing that he enjoys traveling (exploring places like Ghana, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and beyond), modeling, fishing, and more. Given that he is a yacht captain, the Bachelor In Paradise contestant naturally enjoys sailing, as well.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=false>To find out whether Michael Barbour and Olivia Lewis are in it for the long haul,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tune into brand new episodes</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;Bachelor In Paradise&nbsp;every&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;at 9pm ET/8pm CT on ABC, with new episodes available to stream on Hulu the next day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkpawqbHLqKlmoZ5ivaK%2BwJ2grJ1do7K4ecCrqaKukaF6rrXCoZiepF2XrrOuzq6paA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./everytime-video-revisited-following-abortion-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everytime video revisited following abortion news</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-his-leg.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To His Leg?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
