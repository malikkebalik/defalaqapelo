The conference hosts <a href=#>actors</a> and plenty of other creatives from all over the world in entertainment areas like music, comedy, and film, plus tech, culture, and education. It was first launched in Austin, Texas back in 1987 and has been a successful event ever since; it was <a href=#>canceled once in 2020</a> due to covid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gabrielle-Union-new-hair-1-2.jpg><p id=par-2_52>Celebrities often make appearances to speak on panels, and this year, actor and producer Gabrielle Union took the stage during the premiere of “The Idea of You” to discuss the film, which <a href=#>starred Anne Hathaway</a>; Union was one of the producers. The movie had been in the works for nearly six years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gabrielle-Union-new-hair-1-1.jpg><p id=par-3_56>The film centers around 40-year-old Solène Marchand (Hathaway), a divorced mother who who falls in love with 24-year-old band member Hayes Campbell after taking her daughter to Coachella to see her favorite groups. Of course, between Campbell’s fame and the couple’s age gap, things aren’t totally smooth. Union worked on the film alongside producer Cathy Schulman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gabrille-Union-new-hair.jpg><p id=par-4_41>Union has been married to <a href=#>former NBA player Dwyane Wade</a> since 2014, though she attended the conference solo. And while walking the red carpet, Union debuted a brand-new fun, cute hairstyle: gorgeous cornrows that looked like silk running down her back.</p><p id=par-5_50>It’s unclear how much time Union spent on the new look, but the hairstyle could have potentially taken hours given its length and complexity. Each cornrow was perfectly symmetrical to the next and sat harmoniously on her head, waterfalling down her back. Union’s hair was styled by hairstylist Larry Sims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gabrielle-Union-new-hair-1-3.jpg><p id=par-6_60>Union turned heads on the red carpet with not only her hair but her fun, sophisticated-yet-flirty look. She rocked a long, blazer-like sleeveless top paired with shorts that landed just below the knee. A pair of basic black pointed-toe heels completed the look. It gave the illusion of effortless without being effortless at all, and we loved everything about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gabrielle-Union-new-hair-1-4.jpg><p id=par-7_119>Union joined the movie’s other stars and producers on stage at the SXSW conference as well; &nbsp;“The Idea of You” premiered on the event’s closing night and is expected to be released by Amazon on May 2. The film is an adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Robinne Lee. It’s been in the works since it was announced that the novel would become a movie back in 2018. Union has been producing films for a while; she produced the 2014 Lifetime movie “With This Ring” as well. It’s unclear what Union’s next project is, but from what we can tell, she enjoys being behind the camera and will likely have other projects down the road.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0oq7RopylpJViwq%2B1zqdkrqammratv4yfrKdlnprEbrTAoqmsrKmhsm%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marjorie-elaine-harvey-biography-career-net-worth-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marjorie Elaine Harvey Biography - Career, Net Worth &amp;amp; Children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./disney-jollywood-nights-holiday-event-how-to-buy-tickets-and-what-s-included.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Disney Jollywood Nights holiday event: How to buy tickets and whats included</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
