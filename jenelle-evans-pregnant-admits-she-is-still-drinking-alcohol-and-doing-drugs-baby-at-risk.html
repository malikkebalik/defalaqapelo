No! In the interview she mentioned that she has already completed her first trimester of pregnancy. The first trimester of pregnancy is considered the first three months. So, she is at least three months pregnant, meaning she has been pregnant since before September 12th. On September 13th Jenelle Evans made news when she was picked up with her <a rel=nofollow href=#>putative baby-daddy</a> <strong>Nathan Griffith</strong> and hauled off to jail after a high-speed chase with police. On the officer’s dash-board cam Jenelle was seen clearly under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, and she told the officer they were speeding because they were trying to have sex in the car. Jenelle Evans was <a rel=nofollow href=#>using drugs</a> and/or alcohol while she was pregnant! And, putting her new baby in danger by riding in a car with Nathan who was speeding and driving recklessly. And, on September 26th she posted a photo of herself on Twitter drinking Mike’s Hard Lemonade.</p><p>Apparently we aren’t the only ones that have done some math and realized that Jenelle Evans has been drinking and doing drugs while she was pregnant. A friend of Jenelle’s has come forward and confirmed to Radar Online that she was partying in Philadelphia after she found out she was pregnant, and drunk so much she was hung over the next day. Wow, Jenelle, you sure have changed your ways!</p><p>Photo Credit: Twitter</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGxnmpq7prjLnmSerpGjwG680Z6ep5meqXqlvtSgqmacop67rLXNoGSapJOktbC4jJuYm7Fdp7a0t4xqaWpqXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
