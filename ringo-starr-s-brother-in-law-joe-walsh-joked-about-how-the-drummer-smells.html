They became good friends and, decades later, became family when Walsh married Starr’s wife’s sister. The two are close and are always happy to share a kind word about each other in speeches and interviews. When discussing his brother-in-law’s rigorously healthy lifestyle, Walsh joked about the way he smells.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ringo-starr-is-joe-walsh-s-brother-in-law>Ringo Starr is Joe Walsh’s brother-in-law</h2><p id=par-3_55>In 1981, Starr married <a href=#>his second wife, Barbara Bach</a>. She was an American actor and model, and the two have been together for four decades. In 2008, years after Starr and Walsh met and played in the All-Starr band together,&nbsp;<a href=#>Walsh married Bach’s sister</a>, Marjorie. He said he was happy with how tight-knit the family was.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_57>“I feel whole, and I also got, along with her, this huge extended family that came along in the deal,” Walsh told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>&nbsp;in 2013. “They’re very close and they all have each other’s backs and they talk to each other all the time to make sure everybody’s OK, and I’ve never been around that dynamic.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Eagles guitarist described the way The Beatles drummer smells</h2><p id=par-5_50>For years, Starr has adhered to <a href=#>a strict vegetarian diet</a>. As a child, he spent lengthy periods of time in the hospital with illness and drank and used drugs heavily for many years as a musician. By the 1990s, he began focusing on exercise on top of his vegetarian diet.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_121>“I didn’t work out for many years,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;in 2020. “I worked out in nightclubs! [Laughs] But that’s not me now. I started working out. Next door, I have a gym. And I’m in the gym at least three and sometimes six days a week. And, you know, we walk. When I started walking, I was living in Monte Carlo. I’d walk around the port, I’d come back and go into a local restaurant, bum a cigarette, and have a double espresso. I haven’t smoked in a long time, but I still enjoy a double espresso. And I’m a vegetarian. I have broccoli with everything and blueberries every morning. I just do stuff that I feel is good for me.”</p><p id=par-7_19>Walsh joked that Starr’s dedication to his healthy lifestyle is so strong that you can smell it on him.</p><p id=par-8_13>“Every time I see Ringo, he smells of kale,” Walsh told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Walsh gave a speech when Ringo Starr received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star</h2><p id=par-9_36>Walsh and Starr have been friends for years, and they’ve spoken about what the relationship means to them.
