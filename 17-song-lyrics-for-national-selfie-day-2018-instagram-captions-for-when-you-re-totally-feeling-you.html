The holiday that celebrates the digital age of self portraits falls on June 21 in 2018, which means you don't have a lot of time to prepare. That's why I've put together a list of <a href=# class=T3D>song lyrics to use as captions for National Selfie Day</a>, because we all know that taking the picture is only half of a social media post.</p><p>The other half, which is arguably an equally important half, is the caption. You can't neglect the caption! It needs your attention, too! Without a witty, funny, or inspiring caption, a picture is only half-cooked. And let's be honest, a half-assed picture is only going to bring in so many likes. So instead of racking your brains for something punny or wise to say, just use a <a href=# class=T3D>song lyric that describes confidence</a> and self love in just the perfect way. Use your time more wisely by taking well-lit, artsy fartsy pictures of yourself for the national holiday and leave the captions to me.</p><h2>I am beautiful / No matter what they say / Words can't bring me down. - "Beautiful", Christina Aguilera</h2><h2>A Goddess on a mountain top / Was burning like a silver flame / The summit of beauty and love / And Venus was her name - "<strong>Shocking Blue", Venus</strong></h2><h2>I don't mean to brag / I don't mean to boast / I love y'all, but I love me the most. - "I Love Me", Meghan Trainor</h2><h2>You’ve got to get up every morning / With a smile in your face / And show the world all the love in your heart / Then people gonna treat you better / You’re gonna find, yes you will / That you’re beautiful as you feel - "Beautiful", Carol King</h2><h2>Gonna love myself, no, I don’t need anybody else. - "<strong><strong>Love Myself</strong>",<strong> Hailee Steinfeld</strong></strong></h2><h2>What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being / What's wrong with being confident? - "Confident", Demi Lovato</h2><h2>And you're going down without me / You're wishing you had someone like me / I'm one in a million. - "One In A Million", Hilary Duff</h2><h2>I'm not the average girl from your video / And I ain't built like a supermodel / But, I learned to love myself unconditionally. - "Because I Am A Queen", India Arie</h2><h2>Don't criticize yourself no more / You got a smile worth fighting for. - "Brave, Honest, Beautiful", Fifth Harmony</h2><h2>Feeling myself, I'm feeling myself, I'm feeling my-. - "Feeling Myself", Beyonce</h2><h2>Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble. - "Irresistible", Fall Out Boy</h2><h2>Who's been working so damn hard?
