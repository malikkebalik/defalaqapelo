As a young child growing up in Russia, he took classes and competed locally, but eventually left the country to study the art in places such as Germany and England.</p><p id=par-4_37>After coming to the U.S. in 2004, Chigvintsev landed a few acting and dancing roles, including one on The O.C. and multiple gigs on Broadway. and he spent a few years touring with a dance company.</p><p id=par-5_29>He traveled as a professional dancer and choreographer, working on the dance competition series So You Think You Can Dance and Strictly Come Dancing early in his career.</p><p id=par-6_17>Chigvintsev was also married to one of his dance partners, Giselle Peacock, from 2004 to 2005.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-artem-chigvintsev-is-most-famous-for-dancing-with-the-stars>Artem Chigvintsev is most famous for ‘Dancing with the Stars’</h2><p id=par-7_51>Before becoming one of the famed pros on DWTS, Chigvintsev had a good run on the Strictly, which is the U.K. version of Dancing with the Stars.
