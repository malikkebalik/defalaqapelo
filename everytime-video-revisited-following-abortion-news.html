I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">She revealed she had the abortion in late 2000, when she was 18 or 19 years old, and that the procedure was "one of the most agonising things" she had ever experienced.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A year after the pair split, Britney released her album In the Zone, the third single from which was Everytime - a slow ballad which was a departure from some of her earlier, more upbeat releases.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Some fans have gone back to revisit the song's lyrics and believe they could be referencing the abortion, seeing them as an apology to the unborn baby rather than her mourning the end of her relationship with Timberlake.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The song's chorus: "And every time I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me. I guess I need you, baby," is now being interpreted in a new way by some.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The theory has prompted significant discussion among fans and gone viral on social media, where many are re-sharing clips of the music video.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Britney co-wrote the song with Annet Artani, while the music video, released in 2004, was directed by David LaChapelle.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Records from PRS, the body which manages music rights, say the writing split was 65% Britney and 35% Annet.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Writing on social media</a> in 2019, LaChapelle said "the only direction Britney gave me for the video was that she wanted to die in the video".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">LaChapelle's comment came in a reply to a fan's Instagram video, which featured unreleased footage from another video he had worked on with Britney - her 2016 song Make Me.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">He was commenting on <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">how that video wasn't released</a> due to her not liking it and that he always respected her artistic direction when working with her.</p><h4 class="sc-d8a1d567-2 dNWcPM">Allow Google YouTube content?</h4>This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The narrative arc appears to be one life ending, while another one begins.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Britney's live performances have also been mentioned since Britney revealed details of the abortion - with <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">one showing her touching her stomach</a> whilst singing the song and another showing <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">her interrupting a performance to kiss her sons</a> - Sean Preston, now 18, and Jayden James, now 17, whilst they're sitting in the audience.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Justin is yet to comment on Britney's latest revelation but said <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">in a social media post in 2021</a> that he was "deeply sorry" and would "take accountability" after admitting he had failed her during their relationship.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">His song Cry Me A River, released shortly after their breakup in 2002, was seen by some as capitalising on their relationship, as he used heartbreak to promote his music and even featured a Britney lookalike in the video.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Annet has previously said</a> the song was partly intended as a response to Cry Me A River.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"He was talking [rubbish] about her at that time on the radio," she said. "He was getting personal. Here, she had a different type of image, and he was really exposing some stuff that she probably didn't want out there."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Speaking about the process of writing the song,</a> she said: "After the Dream Within a Dream tour in which I sang backgrounds for her, we became friends and bonded over breaking up with our boyfriends.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"So we sat down in her house and starting writing. It was a very cathartic moment to share with another girl who has gone through something similar."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">In a 2003 interview, Britney discussed Everytime,</a> commenting that she wrote "the whole thing from scratch on the piano".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Britney's book is set to focus in part on <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">her 13-year conservatorship</a> under her father James and will be published on the 24 October - two years after the end of the legal arrangement which she says "stripped her of her womanhood".</p>BBC in other languages<span data-testid=level1NavText-/innovation class="sc-7be630a6-3 dyMECJ">Innovation</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o67CZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2Fjp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1lkafBtHmVcGhtbGhsfg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fam-and-nothingburger-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fam and nothingburger added to Oxford English Dictionary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bachelor-in-paradise-new-arrival-michael-barbour.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bachelor In Paradise new arrival Michael Barbour?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
