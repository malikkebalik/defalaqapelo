He's the son of English parents David Wiles, a biochemist, and Pamela Wiles, a homemaker. He has an older brother (Edward) and an older sister (Sophie). Calvin became enamored with electronic music during his teenage years and began recording demos in his bedroom in the late '90s. In order to afford musical equipment, Harris worked stocking shelves in a local supermarket and at a local fish factory as a teenager.</p>Key Facts<ul><li>Richest DJ in the World</li><li>Earns $30-40m per year from touring and royalties</li><li>Has earned $60+ million in some years</li><li>In 2020 sold publishing catalog for $100 million</li><li>In 2018 paid $14 million for a vacant lot in Bel Air</li><li>Owns at least $30 million worth of real estate</li></ul><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2002, Harris released a pair of songs, "Da Bongos" and "Brighter Days", under the name Stouffer. After the release of these two singles, Harris moved to London to further his career. However, the move was short-lived due to the high cost of living in the city. Having only released one single during his time in London, he moved back to Dumfries and began posting music on the early-social media site Myspace. Harris's Myspace was soon discovered by an influential talent manager who soon signed him to his company. Soon afterward, he signed with EMI and Sony BMG.</p><p>His first album, the 80s-inspired I Created Disco, was released in 2007. The album was certified Gold and contained the singles "Acceptable in the 80s" and "The Girls" which charted well in the United Kingdom. Subsequent tours saw him supporting UK electronic legends Groove Armada and Faithless. It wasn't long after his first record that he came to the attention of Australian pop singer <a href=# title="Kylie Minogue Net Worth">Kylie Minogue</a>, whom he would go on to co-write songs for her 2007 album, X. This would begin a long career of collaboration with a number of artists that would lead to many of his biggest hits.</p><p>His second album, Ready for the Weekend, was released in 2009. It contained his first UK #1 hit "I'm Not Alone" as well as the singles "Ready for the Weekend", "Flashback", and "You Used to Hold Me". However, it was his third album that truly catapulted him to superstardom. 18 Months was released in 2012 and was one of the primary forces behind the rise of EDM (electronic dance music) and its takeover of the music charts. Collaborations included some of the biggest names in pop music, including <a href=# title="Florence Welch Net Worth">Florence Welch</a>, <a href=# title="Ellie Goulding Net Worth">Ellie Goulding</a>, and <a href=# title="Ne-Yo Net Worth">Ne-Yo</a>.

The album features collaborations from the likes of <a href=# title="Big Sean Net Worth">Big Sean</a>, <a href=# title="Gwen Stefani Net Worth">Gwen Stefani</a>, and Ellie Goulding.

Perhaps his biggest track of the era, however, occurred when he again collaborated with Rihanna for 2016's "This is What You Came For", which became his highest-charting record as the lead artist. The following year saw the release of Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1., his 5th studio album that saw collaborations from the likes of <a href=# title="Snoop Dogg Net Worth">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=# title="John Legend Net Worth">John Legend</a>, and Future among others.
