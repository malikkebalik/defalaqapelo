Two weeks ago he was living with a $30 million guaranteed contract with The Raiders. After extricating himself from that contract through a series of controversies, he singed a $15 million contract with The Patriots and even caught a touchdown for them last Sunday. That contract was not guaranteed but did come with a $9 million signing bonus. The first $5 million payment of the signing bonus was due to be transferred tomorrow morning. After a series of additional controversies that include sexual assault allegations and farting in a doctor's face, Antonio was released from The Patriots. As of this writing, Antonio is out of a job and likely NOT going to receive a dime of the $9 million signing bonus.</p><p>In total he went from $30 million guaranteed, to $15 million, to probably walking away from the NFL with $138,000 in total earnings for the 2019-2020 season.</p><p>As of this writing Antonio's total NFL earnings are listed $71 million before taxes. We estimate that <a href=#>Antonio Brown's net worth</a> is $25 million.</p><p>Antonio returned to his home in Florida today by private jet. He looked extremely dejected as he walked off the plane. You would feel dejected too if you just let $30 million slip away like a fart in a doctor's face. Especially if you were counting on those future earnings to cover your mortgage and upkeep on your $6.6 million mansion.</p><p>Let's take a look at Antonio Brown's mansion.</p><p>Purchased in 2016 through a trust for $6.6 million, Antonio's mansion is located in Hollywood, Florida, not far from Miami and Fort Lauderdale. He bought the 12 bedroom mansion while still playing for The Steelers. He bought it for $900,000 less than asking.</p><p>The unique property includes a home theater with stadium seating and… a private synagogue. Seriously.</p><p>Check it out:</p><p></p><p>After buying the home in 2016, the Miami-native revealed to a local paper that he was homeless at one point when he was 16. In his words:</p><p>"<strong>I've been fighting for my life before and sleeping in cars and trying to find a place to lay my head. I've had situations where I've had nowhere to go. This is the easy part. I overcame life.</strong>"</p><p>Here's to hoping you can continue to maintain this positive outlook and mansion going forward, Mr. Brown!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeRo8GwusioZJuqn6y7br7ErayrpqNitbC5xGarqGWknba0eZVmbWalmaG5qrvNZp2lp6KesaJ5zJqlrKGfo3q4tdOhZKGho2LBorXLZpmerKeasq95x6KqZqSVnMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-miami-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Miami Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-elin-nordegren-now-all-about-tiger-woods-ex-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where is Elin Nordegren Now?
