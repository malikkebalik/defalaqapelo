After all, one imp is a problem, but two imps is a good time. Or, something like that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thomas-Lennon.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-and-how-will-mxy-return-in-supergirl>When and how will Mxy return in ‘Supergirl’?</h2><p id=par-2_26>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook.com</a>, Thomas Lennon will return to Supergirl on Sept. 14 in episode 11 of season 6. The episode is titled, “Mxy in the Middle.”</p><p id=par-3_80>The synopsis of the episode is, “Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) and team must stop Nyxly (Peta Sergeant) from vanquishing a familiar face from Supergirl’s past – Mr. Mxyzptlk (guest star Thomas Lennon). Mxy returns and explains Nyxly’s dark history to the super team in the best way he knows how – in song form. Meanwhile, Lena (Katie McGrath) visits her mother’s birthplace in Newfoundland, eager to dig into her past but is shocked by the small town’s icy reception towards her.”</p><p id=par-4_41>It makes sense that Mxy would return just as Nyxly is taking over National City and causing problems for the Super Friends. Also, it would be fitting that Mxy uses a song to tell Nyxly’s story. Imps are just the best.</p><p id=par-5_62>Bringing in Nyxly as one of the villains of Supergirl‘s final season is a smart move by the writers. Fans have always loved Lennon’s character because he brought humor and another dimension to the show. And while Nyxly isn’t known for her lightheartedness, she shows another side to Fifth Dimensional imps. Plus, her appearance gave writers an excuse to bring back Mxy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-was-the-last-time-the-audience-saw-mxy>When was the last time the audience saw Mxy?</h2><p id=par-6_44>Mxy was first played by another actor, Peter Gadiot, in Supergirl Season 2. Unfortunately, his character wasn’t well-received by fans because of his intrusive nature. So the show <a href=#>decided to recast</a> and change up the character’s personality. That’s where Thomas Lennon came in.</p><p id=par-7_74>Lennon appeared as Mxy on the 100th episode of Supergirl in season 5, where he was court-ordered to help Kara repair her friendship with Lena. Mxy took Kara through a series of moments where she could have told Lena she was Supergirl, but each scenario took a turn for the worst. Ultimately, Mxy helped Kara accept her decision to hold off on telling Lena about her secret identity for as long as she did.</p><p id=par-8_20>The last we saw Mxy, he was reconciling with Kara and time traveling to the 1780s to experience Mardi Gras.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-other-stars-will-be-returning-to-supergirl-for-its-final-season>What other stars will be returning to ‘Supergirl’ for its final season?</h2><p id=par-9_31>Since season 6 will be Supergirl‘s last, there will be <a href=#>plenty of returning characters</a> to help Kara and the Super Friends fight their final battle. Mxy is just one of many.</p><p id=par-10_42>The show and its stars announced that Mehcad Brooks, Jeremy Jordan, and Chris Wood would reprise their roles as James Olsen, Winn Schott, and Mon-El, respectively, for Supergirl‘s last season. Also, Jon Cryer will return as Lex Luthor before the series wraps.</p><p id=par-11_41>The final few episodes are sure to be a roller coaster ride with epic fights, heartfelt moments, and tearful goodbyes. If <a href=#>what Chyler Leigh had to say</a> about Supergirl‘s last episodes is any indication, fans should get their tissue boxes ready.</p><p id=par-12_8>Supergirl airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtrzEq56iqpxiwam7zJqqZqSVo7uwuoyrnK2toqN6rsTYZqqemaOku26CjJ6noqufmbJvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./young-turk-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Young Turk Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-howard-stern-racist-controversy-and-blackface.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Howard Stern Racist?
