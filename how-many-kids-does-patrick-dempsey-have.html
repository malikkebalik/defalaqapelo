He was a staple of the series for a full decade, serving as one of its most important characters from the very start. That’s on top of his plethora of iconic rom-com roles, from the Enchanted series to Sweet Home Alabama and Can’t Buy Me Love, not to mention his genre-crossing appearances in nearly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">40 years worth</a> of film and television shows.</p><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Just as important to him as his acting career is Dempsey’s passion for sports cars and racing. He’s participated in quite a few races over the years — even placing high in a few — and his team, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dempsey Racing</a>, boasts some pretty impressive sponsors. He spent a good chunk of the 2010’s dedicating as much time as he could manage to the sport, before stepping back and focusing in on his most important pursuit: his family. He still acts from time to time, of course —&nbsp;and I’m sure he’ll never fully leave racing behind — but Dempsey finds plenty of time, these days, for his wife and kids.</p><h2 id=h-patrick-dempsey-s-kids data-injectable=false>Patrick Dempsey’s kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patrick_Dempsey_family.jpg><p data-characters=722 data-current-count=1022 data-injectable=true>Dempsey is in his mid-50s, with nearly four decades of award-winning performances behind him. He was a heartthrob by the early ’90s, in the wake of Can’t Buy Me Love, and that leading man label only stuck more following Sweet Home Alabama. By the time he debuted as McDreamy Dempsey was topping lists of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most eligible male celebs</a> —&nbsp;except he wasn’t eligible. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">man’s been married</a> since 1999 to the same woman, after spending more than a half decade with his first wife — who was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more than twice his age</a>. Its rare you see the predatory Hollywood relationship flipped, but Dempsey is living proof that it happens. Thankfully, following his first marriage, Dempsey found a partner for life.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>He’s been married to his current wife, Jillian Fink, since 1999. The pair share three children between them, two boys and a girl. His daughter, Talula Fyfe, was born in 2002, and twin sons, Darby Galen and Sullivan Patrick, in 2007. Those same kids are edging in on adulthood, these days, just in time to celebrate their dad’s new status as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2023’s Sexiest Man Alive</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMppinsV2gtqW%2FjJ2mnqtdpa61vsicomaclaK9tLHYZp%2BarpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-shell-affair-and-scandal-did-he-cheat-on-his-wife-with-cnbc-anchor-hadley-gamble.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Shell Affair And Scandal- Did He Cheat On His Wife With CNBC Anchor Hadley Gamble?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./do-bug-bombs-kill-bees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Do bug bombs kill bees?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
