He wasn’t involved in any car crash, according to him.</p><p>Fans became frenzied, and numerous condolence posts started pouring in, but some were more skeptical. After all, just a Facebook page stating Lil Uzi Vert’s death can hardly be believed as the high-profile rapper’s demise would have been covered by major media outlets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Web-capture_14-3-2023_10476_www.instagram.com_.jpeg><p>The skeptics were rewarded when Lil Uzi Vert’s reps officially confirmed on Friday, June 19, 2020, that the rapper had become subject to a celebrity death hoax. They said he was alive and well. Viewers and fans have been advised to stop believing everything they see on the internet.</p><p>Learn about: <a href=#>Felton Spencer’s Cause Of Death, How Did He Die?</a></p><h2>Lil Uzi Vert Death News: Real or Hoax</h2><p>A quick search of Lil Uzi Vert’s death on Twitter leads to the news that the rapper has been found dead after news about a shootout. However, a careful reader might pick up that the apparent news is back from 2018, which might be when Lil Uzi Vert was subjected to another death hoax.</p><p>For the time being, fans may be inclined to believe the news of Lil Uzi Vert’s shootout and possible death because they may have confused him with Tray Savage from Chicago. Savage died on June 19, 2020, a day after the hoax about Lil Uzi went viral, which may have added fuel to the fire.</p><p>Furthermore, Tray and Lil Uzi Vert are roughly the same age. The former is 26 years old, while the latter is 25. As a result, the mistake is understandable to the casual reader.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Web-capture_14-3-2023_104616_www.instagram.com_.jpeg><p>However, to conclude, Lil Uzi Vert car accident news was a total hoax; there is no reason to worry as Lil Uzi Vert is alive and doing well. He just has not posted much on social media for a while, but he’s quite active on Twitter, with his last tweet on June 16, 2020, where he interacted with his fans. Moreover, the rapper has a new album in the works, so that is always something to look forward to.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lil Uzi Vert Health Update</h2><p>The official health status of Uzi at present is not disclosed on the internet.&nbsp; However, in the past, he has been open about his struggles with substance abuse and mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.</p><p>More on: <a href=#>Kimberly Achas CCTV Camera Video And Death Cause, What Happened To Her?
