About 32% of today's billionaires did not graduate from college. Of those who did, three times as many billionaires have degrees in the Arts than those who have degrees in Math, Finance, or Science. Now, we normally would not advocate for dropping out of college, except, well, these nine billionaires prove that not having a degree didn't stop them from becoming some of the wealthiest men in the world. That said, dropping out of school was not what made these men billionaires. A big idea, hard work, ambition, dedication, and passion is what made them billionaires.</p><p><a href=#>Ralph Lauren</a></p><p>Dropped out of: Baruch College at The City College of New York</p><p>Source of wealth: fashion designer</p><p>Net Worth: $8.2 billion</p><p>Ralph Lauren famously founded his fashion line with a collection of men's neck ties.

They settled in a small, two bedroom apartment in Mountain View, California, able to do so only because of the assistance of a social support program. While the teenaged Koum worked at a grocery store, his mother babysat for a living so that the family could make ends meet. When he wasn't at work, Koum immersed himself in learning computer networking. At 18, he enrolled at San Jose State University to study programming. He landed a job at Yahoo in 1997 as an infrastructure engineer. In 2009, Koum, alongside <a href=# title="Brian Acton Net Worth">Brian Acton</a>, launched the messaging app WhatsApp, which he subsequently sold to Facebook for $19 billion.

So, he dropped out during his sophomore year and moved to Silicon Valley to devote himself to Facebook full time. Chances are, had Zuckerberg not matriculated at Harvard for at least some time, Facebook probably wouldn't exist at all.</p><p><a href=# title="Ted Turner Net Worth">Ted Turner</a></p><p>Dropped out of: Brown University</p><p>Source of wealth: Turner Broadcasting</p><p>Net Worth: $2.2 billion</p><p>Ted Turner was actually expelled from Brown because he had his girlfriend living with him in his dorm room.
