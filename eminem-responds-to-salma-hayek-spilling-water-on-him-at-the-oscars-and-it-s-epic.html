Some pictures, however, don’t tell the whole story. In a hilarious, yet mortifying run-in between <a href=#>Salma Hayek [Pinoit]</a> and <a href=#>Eminem</a> backstage at the 2020 Oscars, the two unlikely stars literally ran into one another, causing a bit of media confusion. Here’s what actually happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Many are still buzzing about Eminem’s surprise Oscars performance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Salma-Hayek-and-Emenim.jpg><p id=par-2_28>Anyone who watched the 2020 Oscars is still in shock over the surprise performance by rapper, Eminem. Despite all of the amazing nominees, <a href=#>Eminem’s appearance stole the show</a>.</p><p id=par-3_36>What started out as a motivational montage of film scenes, ending with the movie 8 Mile, which opened to the rapper taking the stage to perform the 2003 winner for Best Original Song, “Lose Yourself.”</p><p id=par-4_38>Eminem told <a href=#>Variety</a> the Oscars committee told him they’d planned to pay tribute to 8 Mile in the montage and felt it to be the perfect time to have him since <a href=#>he didn’t attend the ceremony in 2003</a>.</p><p id=par-5_23>“I kinda figured maybe since I didn’t get a chance to do it [in 2003], maybe it would be cool,” Eminem said.</p><p id=par-6_62>“Back then, I never even thought that I had a chance to win, and we had just performed “Lose Yourself” on the Grammys with the Roots a couple of weeks before the Oscars, so we didn’t think it was a good idea. And also, back at that time, the younger me didn’t really feel like a show like that would understand me.”</p><p id=par-7_33>There was one fan in the audience of celebrities who appreciated seeing Eminem on stage. Unfortunately, <a href=#>when meeting Eminem</a>, she did one of the most cringe-worthy things many of us can relate to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Salma Hayek spilled water on Eminem backstage at the 2020 Oscars</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_29>A series of photos <a href=#>posted to Hayek’s Instagram</a> shows the events unfold in slow-motion. You can almost feel Hayek’s embarrassment. Here’s what the superstar said, in her own words.</p><p>In these pictures it might look like&nbsp;@Eminem&nbsp;and I are best friends, but what really happened is as he was walking offstage and I was getting ready to walk onstage, I was so shocked to see him that I spilled water all over him. If you examine our faces, I look mortified and he looks terrified of me- As I was trying to wipe it off I impulsively hugged him and I said “Nice to meet you Eminem- I’m a HUGE fan!” because I AM! But I was so disappointed that I made such a fool of myself in front of him… and then I read this [swipe right] in&nbsp;@rollingstone. Eminem you’re the greatest!!! If you want to read the entire article with&nbsp;#Eminem&nbsp;please see my link in bio.</p><a href=#>Salma Hayek Pinault Instagram</a><p id=par-9_12>Obviously, Hayek is all of us. Luckily, Eminem had the perfect response.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was Eminem’s response to the incident?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u9–aDNWqk&feature=emb_logo</p></figure><p id=par-10_30>In the <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> interview Hayek mentioned in her post, Eminem — whose new album, Music to Be Murdered By, just dropped — was asked if he enjoyed meeting Hayek.</p><p id=par-11_9>“Absolutely,” he said. “I got to hug Salma Hayek!”</p><p id=par-12_44>There you go. The backstory may have never been known had Hayek not explained why Eminem had that expression. It also goes to show that even celebrities stay awake at night re-living a mortifying experience, but sometimes it turns out better than expected.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrrXNnqRmqpWovbC6w6xkrJmcoq5utMCynKRlo6W2rbjIp55mr5GpsrN5zqdkoaGdYq61ec6smpqqo2K2tb%2BMnqeim16dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamie-dimon-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jamie Dimon Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-ted-danson-and-shelley-long-ever-date-in-real-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Ted Danson and Shelley Long Ever Date in Real Life?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
