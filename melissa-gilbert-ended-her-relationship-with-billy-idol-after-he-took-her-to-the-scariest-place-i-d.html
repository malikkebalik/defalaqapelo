Then I moved to his end of the table.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rsz_melissa_gilbert-1-8.jpg><p id=par-4_26>Even at the time, she knew pursuing Idol was “beyond crazy.” However, as the night went on, Gilbert saw a different side to the musician.</p><p id=par-5_52>“He impressed me as a sweet, gentle, and soft-spoken charmer,” she wrote. “He wanted to know all about <a href=#>Michael Landon</a> and he asked what it was like to grow up on television. At the end of the night, we exchanged numbers and a few days later he called and asked me out.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-tabloids-didn-t-know-what-to-make-of-them>The tabloids didn’t know what to make of them</h2><p id=par-6_43>The paparazzi followed Gilbert and Idol on every date they went on. According to the Little House on the Prairie actor, “The tabloids had a field day trying to figure us out. In the public eye, we were the ultimate odd couple.”</p><p id=par-7_22>Idol even called Gilbert “Priscilla,” likening <a href=#>himself to Elvis</a>, another musician with a reputation who ended up with a sweet girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rsz_billy_idol_and_melissa_gilbert.jpg><p id=par-8_18>Oddly enough, though, Gilbert’s mother (normally critical) “liked Billy a lot.” Even so, the relationship didn’t last.</p><p id=par-9_18>“I never had any doubt it was more of an adventure than a long-term arrangement,” wrote Gilbert.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-melissa-gilbert-began-to-pull-back-from-billy>Why Melissa Gilbert ‘began to pull back from Billy’</h2><p id=par-10_58>Gilbert started to question her relationship with Idol at a party he threw after being abroad. It took place at the Bel Age Hotel in Beverly Hills. There, Gilbert “saw serious drug use and people out of control. I stayed until the following afternoon, but afterward I was bothered by the glimpse of darkness I saw that night.”</p><p id=par-11_22>The last straw was when Idol took Gilbert to Rick James’s house, which she describes as “the scariest place I’d ever been.”</p><p id=par-12_22>“I felt a bad vibe as soon as I walked in,” she wrote. “Twenty minutes later, I made him take me home.”</p><p id=par-13_10>After that, the Little House actor pulled back.</p><p id=par-14_41>“That I was even with him shocked the hell out of people, including myself,” she wrote. “But I didn’t want to get involved any further and then have to disentangle myself from something I sensed could turn ugly fast.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6prjIrKqaZZeeuaOx0a1knqaUmrFutMSrZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jJugpaSpYralu8tmmJ%2Bslad6qbGMraaoo12dsrN506hkraCVYsCkrdGinKysXaW5oq%2FEZqCdZZWrsrN5wZ6cp2aYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-janet-jackson-s-super-bowl-nip-slip-created-youtube.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Janet Jackson's Super Bowl Nip-Slip Created YouTube</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-dao-ming-si-sister-dao-ming-zhuang-parents-and-family-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Dao Ming Si Sister Dao Ming Zhuang, Parents And Family Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
