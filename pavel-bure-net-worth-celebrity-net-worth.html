His father was a Russian swimming legend, but Pavel had aspirations to play hockey at an early age. And at 11 years old, Pavel Bure was the best forward in his league. In 1982, he was one of three young Russian players chosen to practice with <a href=#>Wayne Gretzky</a> and Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak on a TV special.</p><h2 id=central-red-army><strong>Central Red Army</strong></h2><p>At 14 years of age, Pavel Bure joined the Central Red Army junior team. And at 16, he began his professional hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. At first he was deemed not ready and too young, but he played minimal minutes filling in here and there for regulars. The next year, he joined the club full time earning Rookie of the Year honors while helping lead the team to its 13th consecutive Soviet championship and 12th consecutive IIHF European Cup. In Bure's third and final year with the team, he tied for the team-scoring lead but turned down a three-year contract extension.</p><h2 id=nhl><strong>NHL</strong></h2><p>Pavel Bure was selected 113th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the sixth round of the 1989 NHL Draft. So in 1991, he joined his father and brother, Valeri, in moving to North America. His first year, he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's best rookie. In the 1993-94 season, he led the NHL in goal scoring and helped the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. After seven years with the team, Bure was traded to the Florida Panthers where he won back-to-back Rocket Richard Trophies as the league's leading goal-scorer. After struggling with knee injuries throughout his career, Pavel Bure announced his retirement in 2005 as a member of the New York Rangers. Pavel Bure was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2012.
