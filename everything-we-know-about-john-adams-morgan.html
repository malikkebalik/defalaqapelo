An <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entrepreneur</a> and fashion designer, Sonja Morgan clearly thrives as a Bravo star.</p><p id=par-2_53>Still, when it comes to her family, Sonja Morgan is fiercely protective. With a high-profile ex-husband and a newly-minted social media star for a daughter, Sonja Morgan has a lot to juggle but never hesitates to speak out in defense of her ex — even though the two have been divorced for years.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-sonja-morgan-best-known-for>What is Sonja Morgan best known for?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sonja-Morgan.jpg><p id=par-3_36><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonja Morgan</a> was born in New York in 1963, raised in a prestigious family. Not content to settle with her family’s inherited wealth, Morgan went on to study marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p><p id=par-4_57>In 2010, after years as a firm fixture of the New York high society scene, Sonja Morgan became one of the stars of Bravo’s The Real Housewives of New York City, joining the cast in the third season. Ever since, Sonja Morgan has been one of the show’s biggest stars, a fan-favorite who always manages to entertain.</p><p id=par-5_58>Along with her tenure on The Real Housewives of New York City, Sonja Morgan has launched many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">successful businesses</a>, including a wine company and a fashion line called Sonja by Sonja Morgan. Sonja Morgan has also lent her time and money to many charitable organizations over the years, focusing on LGBTQ+ rights, children’s causes, and animal rights groups.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-is-sonja-morgan-s-ex-husband>Who is Sonja Morgan’s ex-husband?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_65>The entire time that Sonja Morgan has been on The Real Housewives of New York City, she has been proudly single. Still, there was a time when Sonja Morgan was married, to John Adams Morgan, a member of the prominent Morgan family, and the grandson of J.P. Morgan. The couple first met in the late ’90s, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>, and tied the knot in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_47>John Adams Morgan himself has a prestigious lineage, with ancestors including presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. He was educated at some of the best schools in the world, getting his undergraduate degree from Yale University before competing in the Helsinki Olympics as a sailor.</p><p id=par-8_40>Eventually, he became a financier, according to the family tradition, and built an incredible net worth all on his own. Before meeting and marrying Sonja Morgan, he was married three times before — although little is known about those relationships.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-sonja-morgan-s-daughter-only-recently-entered-the-spotlight>Sonja Morgan’s daughter only recently entered the spotlight</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/SonjatMorgan/status/1390353309152780289</p></figure><p id=par-9_44>In 2000, John Adams Morgan and Sonja Morgan welcomed a daughter, their only child together, although John Adams Morgan has several older children from his previous marriages. Their daughter, Quincy Adams Morgan, was only six years old when the couple divorced in 2006.</p><p id=par-10_55>Since then, John Adams Morgan has remarried, but Sonja Morgan has not. Many wild rumors have circulated about the reason for the couple’s divorce, but Sonja Morgan has remained very restrained, with rarely a bad word to say about her ex. In fact, Sonja Morgan has been deemed overprotective of her family and their history.</p><p id=par-11_70><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonja Morgan is a proud mother</a> to her college-age daughter, praising her as a math whiz: “The finance side, she definitely got from [her father]. She is a math wizard. She got that from the J.P. Morgan side…but she got the humility from the John Adams side, you know, from John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and I like to think my side of the family has humility and religion.”</p><p id=par-12_46>As for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Quincy Adams Morgan</a>, after years of shying away from the spotlight, the young woman recently joined social media, sharing snapshots of her life on Instagram. In time, the young woman could decide to pursue a career in reality television, just like her high-profile mother.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAsLrJmmSmp6Kcrq%2B%2FjJ6vZqClqK%2BiusNmnLGonJa2r7HDZqGooJ5irqWtzKxkpqeinK6vesetpKVn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-potter-s-lightning-bolt-scar-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Potters lightning bolt scar, explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carlos-valderrama-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carlos Valderrama Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
