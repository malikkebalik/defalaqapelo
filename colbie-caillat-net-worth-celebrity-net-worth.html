Her father is record producer Ken Caillat, who won a Grammy for his work on the 1977 Fleetwood Mac album "Rumours." Ken co-produced Colbie's first four albums, and he encouraged her to begin writing songs at an early age. Caillat's parents nicknamed her "Coco" as an infant, and they raised her in Newbury Park, California. During her childhood, Colbie took piano lessons, but after seeing <a href=# title="Lauryn Hill Net Worth">Lauryn Hill</a> in the 1993 film "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit," she was inspired to become a singer. She started taking voice lessons, and when she was in sixth grade, she made her onstage debut in a school talent show. Producer Mikal Blue later hired Caillat to perform on techno songs that were played at fashion shows. She learned how to play acoustic guitar when she was 19 years old, and Blue helped Colbie record the first song she wrote. Caillat auditioned for the Fox singing competition "American Idol," but she didn't make it past the pre-audition stage. The second time she auditioned for the show, she sang her own song, "Bubbly," and though she was rejected that time as well, she told "USA Today" in 2010, "I wasn't ready for it yet. I was glad, when I auditioned, that they said no." Colbie had a very popular MySpace profile, which led to her becoming the top unsigned singer in her genre four months in a row.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Caillat released her debut album, "Coco," on Universal Republic in July 2007, and it reached #5 on the "Billboard" 200 chart and #1 on the "Billboard" Top Rock Albums and Top Alternative Albums chart.
