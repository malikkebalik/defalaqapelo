Three days later, a second stalker broke into his home through a gate that was left unlocked by Reeves' cleaners. The stalker undressed and took a shower in his bathroom before swimming nude in his pool. Reeves was not at home at the time, but the cleaning crew alerted police and the stalker was removed.</p><p>Reeves has a cancer charity he set up, but chose not to attach his name to it.
