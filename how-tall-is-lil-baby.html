The rapper, from Atlanta, first signed with the label Quality Control and began putting out several mixtapes. He also continued to put out songs, including singles and features with the likes of Lil Yachty&nbsp;and Young Thug. His first moderate hit came with “My Dawg, which made it to No. 71 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100 chart.</p><p id=par-3_85>In 2018, he really broke through with the Drake-assisted single, when he released the single, “Yes Indeed,” which featured Drake. It ended up reaching No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was included on his first album,&nbsp;Harder than Ever, in 2018. This was just one of three projects that put out this year. The rapper also put out two mixtapes,&nbsp;Drip Harder&nbsp;(with Young Thug) and&nbsp;Street Gossip. The former included the single “Drip Too Hard.” That song made it to No. 4 on the Hot 100.</p><p id=par-4_68>2019 didn’t see a new project from Lil Baby, though he had two huge hits in “Baby” (with DaBaby) and “Woah.” His 2020 album, My Turn, led by “Woah” has been very successful, hitting No. 1on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart. Almost every song from the album appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. Soon after the regular release, a deluxe version of the album also dropped.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/lilbaby4PF/status/1304496833901756416</p></figure><h2>What Lil Baby has said about his career</h2><p id=par-5_42>For an episode of the Rap Life podcast on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio, Lil Baby expressed why he doesn’t like to compare himself to anyone else in the industry. He also noted the differences between now and back in the day.</p><p id=par-6_50>“I can’t compare myself to nobody in that gap&nbsp;’cause it is a lotta more sh*t nowadays,” he said. I got a whole Instagram with 10 million followers. No way Jay-Z and them had [that]. It’s so many different ways where I won’t even let that get ‘caught in my head.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Lil Baby’s height</h2><p id=par-7_31>Lil Baby is a rapper who is seen by fans to not be necessarily tall or short. Either way, he appears to be perceived by fans to have an average height.</p><p id=par-8_54>And the fans are right. According to <a href=#>Capital Xtra</a>, unlike what his name states, Lil Baby is 5’8”. This makes him taller than a good amount of rappers including Lil Wayne (5’5”), Kendrick Lamar (5’6”), Lil Jon (5’6”), and DaBaby He is also the same height as Kanye West, T.I., and Big Sean.</p><p id=par-9_21>In summation, do not let the name “Lil Baby” make you think that this rapper is shorter than he is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMrZilpF2ewG64yKVkm5mSrnupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-lucas-ii-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Lucas II Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cash-luna-biograf%C3%ADa-edad-altura-esposo-net-worth-familia.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cash Luna biografa, edad, altura, esposo, net worth, familia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
