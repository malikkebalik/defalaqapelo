Buster Keaton was born in Piqua, Kansas in October 1895 and passed away in February 1966. He was known for starring in silent films and known as "The Great Stone Face". Keaton worked without interruption from 1920 to 1929 and critic <a href=# title="Roger Ebert Net Worth">Roger Ebert</a> called him "the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies". Some of his best known films include Sherlock Jr. in 1924, The General in 1926, and The Cameraman in 1928. Keaton had nearly 150 acting credits to his name and another 40 in both writing and directing.

He was earning $3500 per week, the same as around $44k per week after adjusting for inflation. He spent $300,000, or $4.5 million in today's money, building a home in Beverly Hills. That was an unimaginable amount at the time. Unfortunately the good times did not last and Buster was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1934. His career eventually rebounded. Towards the end of his life he could reliable earn $100,000 per year filming commercials.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK%2B2v9OeqWajlZbBsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./e-randol-schoenberg-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>E.
