Plus, a soap opera veteran <a href=#>joins the cast</a> as a corrupt judge. And more familiar faces come to the canvas this week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Days-of-Our-Lives-7.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vanessa-estelle-williams-of-days-of-our-lives-joins-9-1-1>Vanessa Estelle Williams of ‘Days of Our Lives’ joins ‘9-1-1’</h2><p id=par-2_19>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Soaps @ SheKnows</a>, a Days of Our Lives cast member will be doing double-duty on 9-1-1.</p><p id=par-3_79>Vanessa Estelle Williams, whom Days fans know as Eli’s mom Valerie, has just joined 9-1-1 in a recurring role as Claudette Collins. So what does this mean for her work in Salem? “Williams should be available to reprise her soap role when Valerie’s son and daughter-in-law need her support — as in, when the fit hits the shan over the fact that Lani grew up believing that Tamara was her mother when, in fact, Paulina is,” reports the outlet.</p><p id=par-4_29>Williams has been very busy as of late. She recently starred in the new Candyman film, and she’s also filming for Generation Q, which is Showtime’s L Word spinoff.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-soap-opera-veteran-returns-to-the-canvas>A soap opera veteran returns to the canvas</h2><p id=par-5_19>Also this week on Days of Our Lives, a soap opera veteran is also returning to the canvas.</p><p id=par-6_51><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SoapHub</a> is reporting that Richard Steinmetz has begun a recurring stint as Judge Robert Smails. Judge Smails is the same judge that Gwen tried to blackmail. It’s unclear how long Steinmetz will be on the canvas for, but we can expect him to pop up periodically in the coming weeks.</p><p id=par-7_47>Soap opera fans will recognize Steinmetz from his various roles in soaps over the years. He first appeared in soap operas back in 1989, when he was on Loving as Jeff Hartman. Steinmetz held that role until 1993. He also starred in Passions and <a href=#>General Hospital</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-other-comings-goings-from-salem>Other comings & goings from Salem</h2><p id=par-8_72>Speaking of soap opera veterans, John Aniston — yes, father of Jennifer — is back on the Days of Our Lives canvas for the week of October 11. The elder Aniston has been playing the role of Victor Kiriakis since 1985, though his time on the canvas has been significantly reduced now that he’s pushing 90. However, did you know that Aniston originally starred on Days of Our Lives back in 1969?</p><p id=par-9_62>In his original star turn on the show, Aniston played a character called Eric Richards. He only had that role for a year, though, before he left Salem for the first time. Aniston then began starring in other soap operas, including Love of Life and Search for Tomorrow. <a href=#>This was back in the 1970s,</a> when soap operas were at their peak.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_47>Ultimately, though, Aniston rejoined Days of Our Lives in 1985, where he originated the role of Victor Kiriakis. This week, you can expect Victor to work overtime to get Justin and Xander out of jail. Hopefully, we’ll be seeing more of Victor in the coming weeks, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxosXSZqafZZ%2Bqv264yK%2BcrGWTpLqqusasZKCnmaO0tHmYZmhmaV2owaK%2BjKOmoqajYrCiv9Nnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bill-ackman-s-net-worth-and-hedge-fund.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bill Ackmans Net Worth and Hedge Fund</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nate-dogg-net-worth-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nate Dogg Net Worth &amp;amp; Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
