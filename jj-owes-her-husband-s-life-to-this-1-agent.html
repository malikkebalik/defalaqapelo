The series may be over, but at least there are 15 seasons to rewatch episodes whenever fans feels like it.</p><p id=par-2_43>Viewers may recall a moment involving JJ’s (A.J. Cook) boyfriend at the time, Will LaMontagne, Jr. (Josh Stewart). The couple eventually gets married and they have a family, but it wouldn’t have happened if a close call hadn’t been avoided by another agent.</p><h2 id=h-will-s-life-is-on-the-line>Will’s life is on the line</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Joe-Mantegna-Josh-Stewart-AJ-Cook-in-Criminal-Minds.jpg><p id=par-3_77>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS</a>, Will once had bombs attached to him and left for dead by unsubs in an episode of <a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>. It’s a shocking turn of events, and it’s a memorable moment in the two-part finale of season 7. In episode 23 called “Hit,” a group of bank robbers called The Face Cards attempt to rob a bank in Washington, D.C. Will, who is a D.C. detective, shoots one of the robbers after they shoot his partner.</p><p id=par-4_60>The members of the BAU try to play the bank robbers off of each other when they learn that the woman in charge, Izzy Rogers (Tricia Helfer), is working with an outside partner as well as Chris Stratton (Evan Jones) and Oliver Stratton (Seth Laird), two brothers. She even sends a text alerting police about the robbery, which is surprising.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_94>Hostages start being killed, and Oliver also dies from his gunshot wound. Will ends up going inside during the tense moment to avoid the other unsubs from killing people inside the bank. He’s shot two times, but he has a bullet proof vest on, and he sustains a gunshot wound to the shoulder. The hostages are able to escape when Chris takes Will to find the woman who has gone left the main area. Will is then taken as a hostage, and he’s forced to leave with the bank robbers before the building explodes.</p><h2 id=h-jj-owes-her-husband-s-life-to-emily-prentiss>JJ owes her husband’s life to Emily Prentiss</h2><p id=par-6_108>In episode 24 called “Run,” Izzy takes Will to get medical attention for the gunshot wound, killing the medic that helps them. Out of nowhere, she then shoots her partner Chris, leaving him in an alley. Will is forced to drive the stolen federal vehicle to the next location to pick up Izzy’s partner, Matthew Downs (Josh Randall). He was actually inside the bank acting as a hostage during the robbery, and he served in the Marines and was dishonorably discharged. The two met in Chad and fought during civil unrest there, and the date of the robbery and explosion coincides with dates of attacks in that country.</p><p id=par-7_55>Izzy stays in Will’s house with his son, Henry, keeping as a hostage so they can manipulate Will. He’s forced to comply or his son will be killed. Will is needed so that Matthew can pass by the authorities undetected, and he leaves Will in a train station with two bombs attached to him.</p><p id=par-8_79>Agent Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) gets there just in time, but after several wrong attempts, which prompts the countdown to get even closer to detonation, she disarms the bomb by cutting the correct yellow wire with a second to spare. Because of Prentiss’ quick thinking, JJ owes her husband’s life to her. Will is saved because Prentiss got there in time and knew what to do in the moment, and it’s a happy end to a stressful situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AJ-Cool-and-Josh-Stewart-in-Criminal-Minds.jpg><p id=par-9_35>JJ has to fight Izzy, and she knocks her out. Her child is safe, and Izzy is arrested. Agent Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) manages to kill Matthew when he’s fighting Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_42>But there’s a happy moment as well when Will asks JJ to marry him. She says yes, and they have a wedding at SSA David Rossi’s (Joe Mantegna) home in his backyard. It’s a nice way to end&nbsp;a&nbsp;seriously stressful and edge-of-your-seat episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSws7XMoqWapF2itq%2Bw0maho2WfrLK0eceeqWagpaivorrDrGSloZaaerW7jK2foqtdZnqis8Snq2egpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./neil-sedaka-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Neil Sedaka Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-garett-nolan-dating-garett-nolan-s-girlfriend-exes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Garett Nolan Dating Garett Nolan's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
