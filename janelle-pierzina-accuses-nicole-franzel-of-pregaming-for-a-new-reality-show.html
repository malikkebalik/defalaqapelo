It was a milestone season for the reality competition series, so All-Stars was in order. Janelle, one of the most beloved houseguests to ever play the game, appeared on Big Brother 6, Big Brother 7, and Big Brother 14. And Nicole was on Big Brother 16 and won Big Brother 18.</p><p id=par-3_34>Prior to All-Stars 2, Janelle and Nicole competed against each other on The Amazing Race 31, but they never ran into any problems on that show. However, that all changed in Big Brother 22.</p><p id=par-4_68>Janelle and Nicole were on opposite sides of the house, with Janelle working with her Big Brother bestie Kaysar Ridha and Nicole as a part of The Committee. The Committee, which consisted of Nicole, Cody Calafiore, Memphis Garrett, Dani Briones, Tyler Crispen, and Christmas Abbott, dominated the season. And one of their early targets was Janelle. Ultimately, Janelle finished in 14th place, and Nicole came in third place.</p><p id=par-5_44>The majority of <a href=#>Big Brother fans</a> despised All-Stars 2, despite the hype surrounding it. Many believed that the members of The Committee pregamed and decided to align before entering the house. As a result, they steamrolled the competition, making the season predictable and boring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Janelle accuses Nicole of cheating again, but not for ‘Big Brother’</h2><p id=par-6_37>In the years since Big Brother 22 ended, <a href=#>Janelle and Nicole</a> have made it very clear that they don’t get along. And on Feb. 27, 2023, Janelle took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to share some alleged news about Nicole.</p><p id=par-7_55>“Your real spoiler girl is here with some tea,” Janelle wrote. “Not only did Nicole ruin Small Stars by pregaming, but now she is trying to pregame for a new show on Amazon called Battle of the Network Stars. If she is ultimately cast, hopefully, she can own up to being a villain this time.”</p><p id=par-8_26>In the replies, she added, “Why does she continue to pregame? Just say no to pregaming people! It ruins reality television and the fans deserve better.”</p><p id=par-9_55>Nicole responded to Janelle’s allegations while doing a Q&A on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. A fan asked, “Rumor has it you are going to be on a new show Battle of the Network Stars. Is this true?” Nicole answered, “No! Not true. I haven’t even heard of that show until I got a bunch of messages asking today.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Your real spoiler girl is here with some tea. ?<br>Not only did Nicole ruin Small Stars by pregaming, but now she is trying to pregame for a new show on Amazon called Battle of the Network Stars.

So the only information we have about these rumors comes from Big Brother star Janelle Pierzina. But that doesn’t mean that they aren’t true. Unfortunately, there’s no way of knowing what’s correct and what’s false — this is a matter of she said, she said.</p><p id=par-11_50>Battle of the Network Stars was a reality series aired from 1976 to 1988 on ABC, and the network revived the show for one season in 2017. The series featured ABC, CBS, and NBC stars who would compete in several sporting events. In the end, only one network would win.</p><p id=par-12_14>And in 2005, Bravo aired a spinoff called Battle of the Network Reality Stars.</p><p id=par-13_27>So perhaps Amazon is reviving the series, but we’ll have to wait for the streaming service to make an announcement to know if the rumors are true.</p><p id=par-14_11>All <a href=#>seasons of Big Brother</a> are available to stream on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqrOMm6morJiav262wKecpaSVYr2qsdGzoKeZXZawpMHSnqpmppmYvK2xjJ%2BpmqaqmrluvNGenpqlmaO0brrEsGSrnZGhtrXFjKyfqK9encGuuI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ncis-los-angeles-recap-4-20-15-season-6-episode-21-beacon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NCIS: Los Angeles Recap 4/20/15: Season 6 Episode 21 Beacon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-anthony-anderson-married-why-the-black-ish-actor-s-wife-once-filed-for-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Anthony Anderson Married?--Why the 'Black-ish' Actor's Wife Once Filed for Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
