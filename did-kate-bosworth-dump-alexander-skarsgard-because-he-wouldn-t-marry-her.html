It could happen:</p><p>“THE REASON WHY KATE BROKE UP WITH ALEX SKARSGÅRD”</p><p>The truth behind the break-up! The turns have been many, but after a, least to say, turbulent summer, it’s seems like our Swedish hunk Alexander Skarsgård, 33, and his Hollywood-lady Kate Bosworth, 27, has gone seperate ways. They haven’t been seen together in almost two months, and several papers reports about the break-up. Friends to the couple also confirms that the world famous relationship is over.</p><p>They have had a really hard time, and they aren’t likely to find their ways back to each other, says a source.</p><p>Alex himself, doesn’t want to comment the information in the magazine Klick!, and that usually only means one thing…</p><p>The last months, there have been several reports about cheating. Kate’s secret meetings with a handsome, unknown man, was spread in the papers. Secret sex-pics on Skarsgård, both homoerotic and heterosexual nude pictures are spread over the Internet. Kate is said to have hit the roof, over the gay-friendly movie of a stripping Alex, in a tiny apartment, that is now for public show in the net.</p><p>No one wants to see their boyfriend groaning after another man, and caressing his bottom, and kiss a mans back. Kate really doesn’t have that kind of humor. She’s more traditional, a close friend establishes.</p><p>According to close sources Kate has said that Alex is “sooo passé”.</p><p>Kate wants a ring on her finger, and wants to invest in a mature man, to start a family with. Maybe Alex isn’t ready for that kind of life. He’s new in Hollywood and wants to invest in his career, a source says and continues…“Then people have spread lies about cheating and sex scandals, and that’s something no relationship can benefit from,” the source says in conclusion.</p><p>[From Veckans (Swedish publication) via <a href=#>World of Skarsgard</a>]</p><p>Honestly, I don’t think Kate would dump Alexander UNLESS she had another dude waiting in the wings. Someone who could help her career even more, who could get her in the press. That seems to be her M.O. – date (or f-ck) a famous dude, pretend you don’t want the attention while really lapping it up, then moving on to the next dude. Also, I’m guessing the “homoerotic” sex pics that the article is talking about <a href=#>are probably related to this video</a>, which we saw earlier this summer. Alex was obviously drunk, and he obviously has no inhibitions about giving a dude a lap dance or gnawing at another dude’s ass. That makes him “fun” in my book, but whatever.</p><p>Oh, I guess people are thinking the breakup rumors are true because Alex has been away in Europe for months and he and Kate haven’t been seen together in a while, and because he came back to LA and didn’t bring her to the Emmys. Could be…</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9631175/hbo-emmy-party/hbo-emmy-party.jpg border=0 width=500 title="HBO Emmy Party" height=750 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="Aug 29, 2010 - Hollywood, California, USA - Actor ALEXANDER SKARSGARD arrives at the HBO Emmy Party at the Pacific Design Center. &amp;copy; Red Carpet Pictures" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view2.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9393604/burberry-beauty-garden-tea/burberry-beauty-garden-tea.jpg border=0 width=395 title="Burberry Beauty Garden Tea Event" height=594 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JULY 14: Actress Kate Bosworth attends the Burberry Beauty garden tea at a private residence on July 14, 2010 in Beverly Hills, California.
