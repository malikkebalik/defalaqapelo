Today, 20 years after its release, people still quote Witherspoon’s character, Elle Woods.</p><p id=par-2_60>Based on a book <a href=#>inspired by a true story</a>, Legally Blonde follows Woods as she goes to law school after being dumped by her college boyfriend. Warner Huntington III may be one of the most memorable movie boyfriends of the 2000s. And it turns out Matthew Davis, the actor who played Huntington, based his role on a former U.S. president.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Reese-Witherspoon-as-Elle-Woods-in-Legally-Blonde.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matthew-davis-played-elle-woods-boyfriend-she-tried-to-win-back>Matthew Davis played Elle Woods’ boyfriend she tried to win back</h2><p id=par-3_37>Legally Blonde opens with Woods and her best friends and sorority sisters prepping for her big date with Huntington. They go shopping for the perfect outfit before settling on a dress in Woods’ signature color, pink.</p><p id=par-4_40>Woods, a student at a fictional California university, thinks her boyfriend is going to propose on their date. But instead, Huntington breaks up with her for Selma Blair’s Vivian Kensington, saying he needs to “marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_76>After some tears, chocolates, and a manicure, Woods decides she’s going to attend law school to become the type of woman Huntington will marry. But not just any law school, she’s going to Harvard Law School. Woods’ friends, family, and even her guidance counselor doubt she can gain acceptance to the storied university. But Woods is determined. She makes a video for an admissions essay, has a 4.0 GPA, and gets a 179 on her LSAT.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_51>The pink-loving, small dog-owning Gemini vegetarian moves across the country and soon realizes she stands out amongst her fellow Harvard Law students. But she’s focused on proving to Huntington she’s the right woman for him.

Bush</h2><p id=par-7_41>According to <a href=#>Mother-Daughter Movies</a>: 101 Films to See Together, a book by Rosemary Rogers, Davis turned to former President George W. Bush for inspiration. The actor read a biography on America’s 43rd president before taking on the role of Woods’ boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_46>Bush attended Yale University before going to Harvard Business School. As an undergraduate student, he had at least had one thing in common with Woods. In Legally Blonde, she’s president of the Delta Nu sorority. While at Yale, Bush served as the president of his fraternity.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_35>As for Hungtington, he came from a well-to-do family and had political aspirations. And as Kensington tells Woods, he couldn’t get into Harvard Law School on his own. His father had to make a call.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matthew-davis-is-willing-to-reprise-his-role-in-legally-blonde-3>Matthew Davis is willing to reprise his role in ‘Legally Blonde 3’</h2><p id=par-10_66>Legally Blonde is getting another movie.
