The following day, Saturday, Austrian rookie driver Roland Ratzenberger was killed when he smashed into a concrete wall. Senna had only recently met Ratzenberger, but he was emotionally affected by the tragic loss. Ayrton Senna went to see the scene of the accident, climbing over the medical fence to see the crash site. Senna spent his final morning meeting with fellow drivers and considering how to best improve driver safety for Formula One. On the 7th lap, Senna also suffered a fatal crash. On the high-speed Tamburello corner, the car left the track at around 205 mph (330 km/h), hitting the concrete retaining wall at around 135 mph (217 km/h). Although he was rushed to hospital, he was declared deceased on arrival. His death was a great shock to the world of sports, and to Brazil in particular. It is estimated that upwards of three million people lined the streets of Sao Paulo for the return of his body.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-298869 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Ayrton-Senna-1.jpg alt width=900 height=651 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-298869 class=wp-caption-text>Pascal Rondeau/Getty Images</p><h2 id=philanthropy><strong>Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>Senna was deeply impacted by the poor of Brazil.
