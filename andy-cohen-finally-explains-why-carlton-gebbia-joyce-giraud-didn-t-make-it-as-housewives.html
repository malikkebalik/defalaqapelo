Credited as an executive producer on all of the <a href=#>different adaptations</a> of the reality show, he is known to be involved in creative decisions. One of the questions that always keep coming up is why Carlton Gebbia and Joyce Giraud didn’t make it past their first seasons on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/andycohen-carltongebbia-joycegiraud-rhobh.jpg><p id=par-2_39>Back in season 4 of RHOBH, the show went through some cast changes. At the time Adrienne Maloof and Taylor Armstrong quit the show. Their replacements were Gebbia and Giraud who ended up being replaced only after one season.</p><p id=par-3_27>During an interview with Kyle Richards on the Watch What Happens Live: After Show, Cohen explained the reasons why the Housewives didn’t make it past season 4.</p><p id=par-4_67>“I think Carlton and Joyce would’ve been great on their own but the problem is that they didn’t have existing connections to the group,” Cohen revealed. “I think that was part of the reason we all kind of realized that it was a great time to bring in Lisa Rinna because not only she’s such a great character, but she was really connected to all of you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rhobh-season4-bravo.jpg><h2>Kyle Richards likes to pretend Season 4 didn’t exist</h2><p id=par-5_44>Richards said on WWHL that she likes to pretend season 4 didn’t exist. During this season she found herself at odds with Gebbia. When a fan wanted to know which housewife Richards thought had brought the least to the show, the answer was predictable.</p><p id=par-6_22>“That would be season 4… umm… Carlton [Gebbia],” she said without much hesitation. “That’s the season I like to pretend never happened.”</p><p id=par-7_21>The late-night host also remembered that he thought it was hilarious that Richards thought Gebbia put a spell on her computer.</p><p id=par-8_36>“That was just weird. Everything she did was just so friggin freaky,” Richards replied. “I’m still convinced that she put a spell on me because bees always torture me and come in the most random places.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Carlton Gebbia after leaving ‘RHOBH’</h2><p id=par-9_18>Back in 2014 and after Gebbia was let go from RHOBH, she called it a “blessing in disguise.”</p><p id=par-10_56>“I sort of look at it as a blessing in disguise because my husband does have a project in the works, a reality show,” Gebbia told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="E! New (opens in a new tab)" href=#>E! New</a>s. “It’s something that would give me the opportunity to work with him. I was contractually obligated for a three-year deal and if that’s the case, I’m not anymore.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-11_20>Although she enjoyed her time on the Bravo network, there’s one aspect of the show she said she wouldn’t miss.</p><p id=par-12_25>“I would like to go into a show and not have to watch the knives coming at my back,” she added. “That would be great!”</p><p id=par-13_53>Since then many other Housewives have been added to the cast including Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp, Denise Richards, and Garcelle Beauvais. None of the aforementioned have had any strong feuds with Richards on camera as the Wiccan. Perhaps that might be the reason Richards names Gebbia as her least favorite co-star.</p><p id=par-14_14>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvBoWSappSueqS7x56lZq%2BYrnqkrdGlq6imXZyyo67ImmSjp6mYsm6zyKuYrpxdnby2v8SwoK%2Bdo2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-kate-bosworth-dump-alexander-skarsgard-because-he-wouldn-t-marry-her.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Kate Bosworth dump Alexander Skarsgard because he wouldnt marry her?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amazon-holiday-pay-explained-guide-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amazon Holiday Pay Explained (Guide 2022)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
