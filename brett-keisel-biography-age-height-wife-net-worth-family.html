While agent Eric Metz stated that Keisel "has every intention to continue to play football," no contract had yet been offered by the Steelers organization.</p><p>On August 19, 2014, Keisel agreed to re-sign with the Steelers, signing a 2-year contract worth $3 million which includes a $500,000 signing bonus.</p><p>On February 24, 2011, "Da Beard" was removed during a ceremony titled "Shear the Beard" in downtown Pittsburgh. The event raised over $40,000 for the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. Keisel stated that "Da Beard" would most likely return for the upcoming season. "Da Beard will decide when the time is right to come back," he said, "and it will all of a sudden appear." Keisel dubbed the 2011 season "Da Beard Revenge Tour." On February 9, 2012, Keisel held "The Second Annual Shear the Beard Event." Just as in the previous year, proceeds raised went to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. It was announced on January 8, 2013, that "The Third Annual Shear the Beard Event" would be held on February 7, 2013, at Jergel's Rhythm Grille in Warrendale, PA, with all proceeds benefiting the cancer program at Children's Hospital.

Keisel's facial hair gained fame during the end of the 2010 NFL season. Many NFL players grow "rally beards" during the playoffs to bring them good luck.
