That net worth estimate includes a low-range valuation of her art collection. That collection featured at least one <a href=#>Andy Warhol</a> portrait which alone was valued at more than $12 million at the time of her death. We say "at least one" in the previous sentence because technically at the time of her death she possessed TWO Warhol portraits of herself. As we detail later in this article, a legal battle ensued after it was discovered that the second portrait was removed by her partner <a href=#>Ryan O'Neal</a> after her death in 2009 and ended up at his Malibu house.</p><p>Farrah Leni Fawcett was born in Corpus Christi, Texas in February 1947 and passed away in June 2009. She was perhaps best known for her role on Charlie's Angels. TV Guide ranked her as the #26 greatest TV star of all-time in 1996. She had recurring roles on TV shows Harry O and The Six Million Dollar Man. She played Jill Munroe in Charlie's Angels from 1976 to 1980.</p><p>In 1995 Fawcett was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She won a People's Choice Award in 1977 and two TV Land Awards in 2004. She was nominated for five Golden Globes four Primetime Emmy Awards. Fawcett was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2006. The documentary Farrah's Story aired in May 2009 and she passed away on Jun 25, 2009 at 62 years old.</p><h2 id=iconic-poster-earnings><strong>Iconic Poster Earnings</strong></h2><p>In 1976, Farrah appeared in a poster that would eventually become an iconic image of the 20th century. In the poster Farrah is wearing a skin-tight bathing suit with her blonde hair flowing over her shoulders. It eventually became the best-selling poster of all time, selling more than 6 million prints, and made Farrah famous worldwide. The fame resulting from the poster is what landed Farrah her first major television roles. The bathing suit she wore is now in the Smithsonian Museum.</p><p>Farrah earned 40% of all profits generated by the poster. With 6 million prints sold, <a href=#>the poster generated around $12 million in revenue, $2 million in profits</a>. That works out to $800,000 in royalties to Farrah which is the same as $3.6 million after adjusting for inflation.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-355530 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Farrah-Fawcett.jpg alt width=900 height=606 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-355530 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Fotos International/Frank Edwards/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=charlie8217s-angels-salary><strong>Charlie's Angels Salary</strong></h2><p>Farrah Fawcett earned $5,000 per episode of the first season of Charlie's Angels. After the first season, producers increased her salary to $10,000 per episode salary (roughly $44,000 today after adjusting for inflation). Farrah, who by then was earning far more from her poster royalties, was unsatisfied with the salary and left the show. In 1976 when she made $5,000 per episode, over 22 episodes she made $110,000. That's the same as around $490,000 today after adjusting for inflation. In the same year Farrah made $400,000 in royalties from her poster. That's the same as $1.8 million. Still, despite her dissatisfaction with the Charlie's Angels salary, producers held her to a contract that required Farrah to appear in the next two seasons as a frequent guest star.</p><h2 id=other-work><strong>Other Work</strong></h2><p>She starred in the films The Burning Bed and Small Sacrifices in the 1980s. In 1997 she starred in The Apostle with <a href=# title="Robert Duvall Net Worth">Robert Duvall</a>. She had recurring roles on shows Spin City and The Guardian.</p><p>In her Charlie's Angels days she was known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors as she was married to actor <a href=# title="Lee Majors Net Worth">Lee Majors</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-304076 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Farrah-Fawcett.jpg alt width=826 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-304076 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=farrah-fawcett8217s-death-estate-will><strong>Farrah Fawcett's Death, Estate and Will</strong></h2><p>Tragically, Farrah Fawcett died in June 2009 after a three year battle with cancer. The approximate total value of her estate, liquid assets and non-liquid assets combined, was $20-40 million. Her estate include cash, real estate, art, memorabilia and her image rights. According to her will, Farrah left her art collection to the University of Texas at Austin. The collection was supposed to include TWO Andy Warhol-produced portraits of Farrah that were both worth an estimated $12 million at the time. More on this in a moment.</p><p>She left an undisclosed portion of assets and money to the Farrah Fawcett Foundation which aims to provide funding for cancer research and prevention. She left $500,000 a piece to her father and nephew.</p><p>Farrah left the bulk of her estate, roughly $4.5 million in cash, to her son <a href=#>Redmond O'Neal</a> in a lifetime trust that came with strict parameters and restrictions. Farrah left her producer friend Richard Francis as trustee of the trust. Redmond is only entitled to interest generated by the trust. Francis can choose whether to distribute the interest income quarterly or once per month. Redmond can only tap into the principal for health care at the discretion of Richard Francis. Redmond can not even use the principal for his legal defense or bail when he is involved in with the police. He must rely exclusively on the interest which likely amounts to around $300 thousand per year before taxes. When Redmond was arrested in 2018, he did not have enough money to cover his $50,000 bail.</p><h2 id=andy-warhol-painting><strong>Andy Warhol Painting</strong></h2><p>In addition to her cash bequeaths, Farrah's will dictated that her art collection be gifted to the University of Texas at Austin, her alma mater. Most notably, the collection included <strong>ONE</strong> <a href=#>Andy Warhol</a> portrait of Farrah. Keyword, "ONE."</p><p>A few months after her death, Farrah's college boyfriend (who was also the star quarterback for the school in the 1960s while they dated and reportedly HATED O'Neal), alerted the school that Andy actually produced TWO portraits, one of which mysteriously went missing from Farrah's LA condo soon after her death. After an investigation, the university suspected Ryan O'Neal had taken the portrait for himself. That suspicion turned out to be true, thought it wasn't officially confirmed until 2011 when it was seen in the background an episode of the reality series "Ryan and Tatum: The O'Neals." In the episode the portrait could be seen hanging in the master bedroom of Ryan's Malibu beach house.</p><p>After spotting the painting in the show, a legal battle was launched by the university. In the trial, Ryan argued that while Andy did indeed produce two portraits of Farrah during her 1980 session with the artist, she did not actually own the second one at the time of her death. He did. According to Ryan, he introduced Farrah to Warhol â€“ a friend of his â€“ and arranged for the portrait session on the condition that two pieces would be produced, one for him and one for her.</p><p>In December 2013, an LA jury ruled in Ryan's favor, allowing him to keep the painting. The value of the painting at the time was estimated to be $18 million. In 2018 it was appraised at $24 million.&nbsp; Today it could be worth $40+ million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247821 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ff.jpg alt width=562 height=594 sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247821 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Farrah was, somewhat secretly, an extremely shrewd real estate investor. At the peak of her career earnings-wise, she invested in personal homes in Bel-Air and Malibu, both of which would later grow to be extremely valuable. She also reportedly took all of her earnings from several 1970s movies and acquired trailer parks for senior citizens. By the 1990s, the value of those real estate assets was estimated to be $20 million, roughly $40 million in today's dollars.</p><p>For several decades her long-time personal home was a 5+ acre compound in Bel-Air which she pieced together over two transactions. The first parcel, roughly 2.8 acres, was acquired in the 1970s for an undisclosed amount. In 1991 she paid $1.7 million (the same as $3.3 million today) for the 2.4-acre property next-door. In 1999 Farrah sold the main parcel (the first one) for $2.7 million. The home â€“ which is 12,000 square-feet and has a movie theater + basketball court + recording studio and more â€“ was bought by <a href=# title="Nick Cannon Net Worth">Nick Cannon</a> and <a href=# title="Mariah Carey Net Worth">Mariah Carey</a> in 2009 for $7 million. In the wake of their divorce, Nick and Mariah tried to sell the home for $13 million, but ultimately accepted $9 million in 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLOivtGan2aekaywpsDTZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-varvatos-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Varvatos Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mariah-brown-says-she-might-have-been-a-polygamist-if-her-family-had-stayed-in-utah.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Mariah Brown Says She Might Have Been a Polygamist If Her Family Had Stayed In Utah</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
