However, the accolade went to Sudeikis, who stars in Apple TV’s <a href=#>Ted Lasso</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_24>Throughout his career, Anderson hasn’t said much about his personal life.

During the late ‘90s, the actor got his big break with a part in Liberty Heights. Once the movie wrapped, he appeared in films such as Me, Myself, and Irene, Kangaroo Jack, and Malibu’s Most Wanted. Additionally, Anderson lent his talents to TV with guest spots on The Bernie Mac Show in the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_46>In 2014, the actor returned to TV with Black-ish.

According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>, the Barbershop star separated from his wife, Alvina Stewart, in 2015. The couple, married in 1999, were high school sweethearts and cited “irreconcilable differences” for their split.

In a 2018 interview with Rachel Ray, the Hustle & Flow actor said his son works as an actor. Before Anderson’s son took another role, he wanted Nathan to play one of his kids on Black-ish.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=par-11_114>“My son is a young, talented actor, following in my footsteps… Has a new show that’s going to be on <a href=#>Netflix with Rev Run</a>,” he said. “They’re starting in January, and he’s going to play Rev Run’s son.” He continued, “I wanted him to be Andre Jr. on Black-ish, but my son’s cool factor… You know, he just has a little too much swag, and I don’t know where he gets it from. I sometimes question if he’s mine or not. His swag factor is just off the charts! And we needed him not to be goofy but just be a nerdy kid, and he couldn’t shake that. And so I couldn’t cast him!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrrnYrGRraGJmeqK606Gmp7FdlrulsdGspqdlnZa%2Fs7XEnWSbpJGYuG610qFkmpukpL%2B0edainZ5llp65prCMnaCvp6KYsm%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./janelle-pierzina-accuses-nicole-franzel-of-pregaming-for-a-new-reality-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Janelle Pierzina Accuses Nicole Franzel of Pregaming for a New Reality Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-price-obituary-death-ex-wales-triple-crown-captain-brian-price-dies-at-86.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Price Obituary-Death; Ex-Wales Triple Crown Captain, Brian Price Dies At 86.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
