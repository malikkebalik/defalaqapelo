Then viewers got wrapped up in the next generation of Karate kids. Moon (Hannah Kepple) is one of the teenagers in high school with Samantha (Mary Mouser) and Miguel (Xolo Maridueña). She doesn’t train in Karate but she’s been a love interest to more than one character.</p><p id=par-2_13><strong>[Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for </strong><strong>Cobra Kai </strong><strong>Seasons 1 and 2.]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hannah-Kepple-with-Mary-Mouser-and-Tanner-Buchanan.jpg><p id=par-3_36>Kepple spoke with Showbiz Cheat Sheet by phone about her role on Cobra Kai. She reflected on some of Moon’s romantic moments. We’ll have more with Kepple before Cobra Kai Season 3 returns Jan. 8, 2021.</p><h2>Hannah Kepple’s first ‘Cobra Kai’ romance</h2><p id=par-4_34>Moon began as one of the popular girls with Samantha and Yasmine (Annalisa Cochrane). Before Cobra Kai, they wouldn’t pay attention to Eli (Jacob Bertrand), but when he became Hawk, he won Moon’s heart.</p><p>It was totally unexpected. I can’t remember if somebody read it on a script and told me or if I read it on a script and found out that way, but I love it. I think they’re great together. They’re kind of a juxtaposition of characters but they kind of have their own chemistry. I think they care about each other. And then obviously, we know in season 2 they don’t work out but who knows what the future holds? I’m excited either way but I think they’re both really fun characters.</p>Hannah Kepple, interview with Showbiz Cheat Sheet, 11/5/2020<p><h2>Hanna Kepple is proud of Moon in this scene</h2></p><p id=par-5_30>In Cobra Kai season 2, Hawk overcompensates with his newfound confidence and becomes a bully to his former friends like Demetri (Gianni Decenzo). Moon broke up with Hawk for bullying.</p><p>I think it was unexpected. At least when I looked at the scene, I don’t think when Moon was having that conversation with Hawk she necessarily knew she was going to break up with him. But, I think when she heard his response to her calling him out and being the bully in the situation, I think she realized that she didn’t want to have that in her life anymore. As long as he was choosing to be a bully and not be the better person, she just didn’t want that in her life. I think that’s understandable. I think situations like that just kind of culminate and that was the end result.</p>Hannah Kepple, interview with Showbiz Cheat Sheet, 11/5/2020 <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cobra-Kai-girls.jpg><p id=par-6_25>It’s easy to see why the confidence Cobra Kai Karate gave Hawk’s was attractive to Moon, but she was smart enough to recognize a bully.</p><p id=par-7_52>“I was really proud of her,” Moon said. “I thought that was a great Moon moment for her to step away from the crowd and what the popular people might think and really decide for her own what she wants in her life and the people she wants to surround herself with.”</p><h2>Moon’s second ‘Cobra Kai’ romance was no surprise to her</h2><p id=par-8_28>Towards the end of season 2, Moon shows up at a party with Piper (Selah Austria). It was easy for Kepple to embrace the shift in Moon’s sexuality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cobra-Kai-Moon-and-Piper.jpg><p id=par-9_91>“I was really excited for that because I think it’s so important to have all different types of representation on the show,” Kepple said. “I was really excited that they wanted to bring that into the show and honestly, I wasn’t surprised at all because it just made sense. That’s who Moon is. She loves who she loves. It doesn’t matter your gender or who you are or how you identify yourself. So it made sense for me and I was just really excited to have that representation on this show.”</p><p id=par-10_13>Kepple hopes Piper paves the way for more LGBTQ representation on Cobra Kai.</p><p id=par-11_38>“I really hope they choose to explore that a bit more, maybe even have some other characters who identify different ways and have different views on things,” Kepple said. “So I’m excited. I thought that was really cool.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwsK7RmmSkmZliwLWt0WafmqaelrVut8Spp6WdXayutLrTZqquqqCntrSxw2aZsmWdpLyvv4ylpq%2BdXaG2p7GMra6iq6Ritaa%2BxKxksKCpY7W1ucto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./awards-season-calendar-2023-2024-key-dates-and-timeline-for-oscars-dga-wga-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Awards Season Calendar (2023-2024): Key Dates and Timeline for Oscars, DGA, WGA and More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nikita-mishin-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nikita Mishin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
