Since 90 Day Fiancé season 5, the couple has been a staple of the TLC franchise making appearances on What Now? and Pillow Talk and becoming favorites of viewers in the process. David and Annie have been given their own spinoff, and it will be back in December.</p><p>As seen in a sneak peek from David & Annie: <a href=# rel=noopener>ET</a> has posted a clip from the second half of After the 90 Days, in which David and Annie go to the doctor after a scare.<a href=# rel=noopener> Dr. Jones</a> inquires as to when Annie’s last period was, and she reveals that it has been three months since she last had one.</p><p>A follow-up check seems to indicate possible pregnancy evidence, though this isn’t confirmed in the teaser. Annie, in a speechless interview, said, “Whoa, nelly. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life.” Annie’s reply demonstrates how unprepared Annie and David were for this moment, despite the fact that they have both undergone considerable transformations recently.</p><h2>David Toborowsky of “90 Day Fiancé” Stunned by Possible Pregnancy News</h2><p>It seems that David was experiencing the same level of shock and bewilderment. In an interview, he said, “I didn’t believe I would ever think about being a father again.” Ashley, his daughter from a previous marriage, made an appearance on 90 Day Fiancé and was very critical of her father’s dating choices.</p><p>You can also read about these celebrities’ pregnancy:</p><p>The 90-Day Fiance series began with the Louisville native being unemployed and unable to pay the obligatory bridal dowry to Annie’s family. Starting a new family with Annie would be a dramatic departure from his humble beginnings. Recent weight loss has made David more emotionally stable and better able to deal with this news, but he still appeared shocked during the assessment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/90-Day-Fiance-David-and-Annie-baby.jpg><p>There’s a reason Annie and David have become series regulars on the 90 Day Fiancé spinoffs, from David’s slacker beginnings to their current roles as raucous Pillow Talk pundits. The same adoring public that has cheered David and Annie on in these roles: Fans of the first season of After the 90 Days will be thrilled by the couple’s potential pregnancy.</p><p>However, the Toborowskys face substantial obstacles that may prevent them from providing their undivided care to a child. The teaser also showed that David and Annie spent a lot of time preparing their family for the transfer to America, despite the fact that certain members of the family were loud about not wanting to go. Fans of 90 Day Fiancé are used to conflict, but rarely does it involve a new pregnancy.</p><p>It’s still likely that David and Annie will be good parents. As a result of his time on 90 Day Fiancé, David has not only grown as a person, but he also has prior experience as a parent and grandparent. Many viewers of “90 Day Fiancé” are quick to point out that Annie has already expressed her desire to become a mother on the show and they are confident that she will succeed in this new position.</p><p>Anyone who has seen them on 90 Days to a Fiance will know that Annie and David have a genuine affection for one another, a quality that they should bring with them into their new position as parents.</p><h2>David and Annie Pregnant: In this first look of the 90 Days Fiancé Season 2 Annie’s Pregnancy Status is Revealed</h2><p>David & Annie: David Toborowsky and Annie Suwan, beloved by viewers of 90 Day Fiancé, are rumored to be ready to start a family now that After the 90 Days is back for a second season.

David is bringing his daughter Ashley to the village this time so that she can meet Annie’s relatives.</p><p>On the other hand, things are more complicated now that Jordan isn’t sure he wants to travel to America at all because he’d have to leave his fiancée. Jordan accuses Annie of “pushing” him to come to America, leading to an altercation between the two of them. Jordan storms off.</p><p>Read about these celebrities’ personal life:</p><p>The trailer takes an unexpected turn, however, when Annie reveals to a doctor that she hasn’t had a period in three months.
