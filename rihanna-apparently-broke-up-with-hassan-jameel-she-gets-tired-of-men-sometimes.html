Rihanna had been keeping information on her love life on lockdown for a while, and I think some people suspected that she had someone, but no one could nail down just who it was. Then a paparazzo got photos of Rihanna and a wealthy Saudi man named Hassan Jameel in some kind of sexy Jacuzzi situation, and <a href=#>suddenly we knew</a>. This was who she was hiding. Hassan was apparently really into her, and he lavished her with gifts and he was at her beck and call. But now it’s looking like things are over?</p><p>MediaTakeOut News is reporting that Rihanna has ended things with her billionaire boyfriend of over one year, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, because she just “gets tired of men sometimes.”</p><p>“Rihanna and him were together for a while,” a source told the outlet. “It was a good relationship, but now it’s over. Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does: break[s] men’s hearts.” There was nothing salacious or explosive about the ending either, the source claimed. “Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Elle]</a></p><p>I’m not going to say this as a criticism, but merely as an observation: Rihanna seems like one of those women who gets bored very easily in relationships, which is why I think she tends to go back and forth between “good guys” and very damaged men. Like, her head tells her to go for someone more stable and nice, but she usually gets bored with those dudes pretty quickly, and then she needs a fling or a relationship with a guy who brings a lot of drama and damage to the table. My guess is that if Hassan and Rihanna did break up, it’s just as they say: she got tired of him. She got bored with him. On to the next one, Rih.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn34175375.jpg alt="The 2018 Costume Institute's MET Gala Benefit - Red Carpet Arrivals" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm9pbX5ze9Gin5qmnpasorzPmqmepqShxqCu0aiinpelpay4tdOhlqGZo6iur6vJmqSenZyUwKmxvqCcrauPqbazscOYpp%2BXnZq7oL%2FOppytoZ2awHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-wtd-mean-on-snapchat-tiktok-and-texting.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does WTD mean on Snapchat, TikTok, and texting?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lacy-hartselle-wiki-age-boyfriend-height-parents-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lacy Hartselle Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Height, Parents &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
