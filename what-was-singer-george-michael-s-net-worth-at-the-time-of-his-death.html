He was 53.</p><p id=par-4_54>His publicist released a statement on behalf of his family which read, “It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period. The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time.”</p><p id=par-5_38>There were initial reports that Michael died of heart failure. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BBC (opens in a new tab)" href=#>BBC</a> noted that the official coroner’s report later attributed his&nbsp;death&nbsp;to natural&nbsp;causes and said the star was suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and a fatty liver.</p><p id=par-6_12>He was buried at&nbsp;Highgate Cemetery&nbsp;in London, near his mother’s grave.</p><h2>His early days as one half of the duo Wham!&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/George-Michael-3.jpg><p id=par-7_49>Michael, who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou on June 25, 1963, decided to form a band with Ridgeley and three others when they were in high school. The group was called The Executive but after only playing a few shows, Michael and Ridgeley became a duo in 1981.</p><p id=par-8_43>“We were both dabbling with music but no, I persuaded George, railroaded him really into forming a band,” Ridgeley told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BBC Radio 2 (opens in a new tab)" href=#>BBC Radio 2</a>. “I think we both had the belief that we would make it. That was the central pillar around everything else.”</p><p id=par-9_15>The two went on to sell 30 million records worldwide, but they split in 1986.</p><p id=par-10_43>“I think we achieved what we wanted to achieve,” Ridgeley said about their decision to break up. “It was a short time period but we had broken America, we had been a worldwide success, and certainly George, as a songwriter, was outgrowing Wham!”</p><h2>Michael’s solo career and net worth when he died</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/George-Michael-2.jpg><p id=par-11_26>After his Wham! days, Michael enjoyed a ton of success as a solo artist with hits including “Faith,” “Father Figure,” “One More Try,” and “Freedom.”</p><p id=par-12_31>Michael’s “Freedom 90” music video is one of the most memorable of that decade and featured supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, and Cindy Crawford&nbsp;lip-syncing his words.</p><p id=par-13_37>Michael sold over 115 million records&nbsp;around the world and according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Celebrity Net Worth (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, was worth $200 million at the time of his death.
