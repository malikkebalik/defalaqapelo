In its 15th season since 2014, fans can recap previous seasons on Netflix, where season 10 landed in April 2022.</p><p id=par-2_39>If you want to catch up on your favorite couples from previous seasons, tune in to the streaming service. See how the <a href=#>five couples from season 10</a>, which aired back in January 2020, are doing a few years later.</p><h2 id=h-recapping-season-10-of-married-at-first-sight>Recapping Season 10 of ‘Married at First Sight’</h2><p id=par-3_50>Season 10 of the <a href=#>Lifetime</a> show featured five couples from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. This was the first season that followed five couples instead of four. Picked by Dr. Pepper Schwartz, Pastor Calvin Roberson, and Dr. Vivian Coles, these five couples had big choices to make on Decision Day.</p><p id=par-4_37>As of this writing, the show has an overall success rate of 24%, meaning that 24% of the <a href=#>couples have stayed married</a> after their season ended. This is a pretty accurate percentage for Season 10 couples, too.</p><h2 id=h-austin-and-jessica-hurd>Austin and Jessica Hurd</h2><p id=par-5_59>In the early summer of 2022, Jessica (Struder) and Austin Hurd took their cuter-than-adorable son, Westin, to Wakins Glen, New York to spend time with extended family. Austin paid tribute to his wife on her first Mother’s Day with a video montage of her being a mom; Jessica returned the favor a month later for Austin’s first Father’s Day.</p><p id=par-6_23>This was the only match from Season 10 that the experts got right! Congrats to the <a href=#>happy couple and their beautiful baby boy</a>.</p><h2 id=h-meka-jones-and-michael-watson>Meka Jones and Michael Watson</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_40>Meka and Michael chose an annulment after their marriage. She expressed trust issues regarding her new husband’s job status and moneymaking ability. They were the first couple in the show’s history to get an annulment rather than an all-out divorce.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_52>Mike felt from the get-go that he and Meka weren’t a good match. A year later, Mike married his girlfriend, Shay, and they posted some <a href=#>videos on YouTube</a> about their lives as a married couple. Meka, meanwhile, has been enjoying time with her family, a cadre of girlfriends, and her adorable pup.</p><h2 id=h-zach-and-mindy>Zach and Mindy</h2><p id=par-9_63>Despite both of them being <a href=#>fitness gurus</a>, Mindy Shiben (a figure skating coach) and Zach Justice (a fitness professional), they didn’t gel as a couple. Zach admitted he never felt attracted to his chosen bride. Their coupling proved that you can’t just throw two people together and expect them to fall in love. Plus, Zach made some questionable choices during their time together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zach-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10.jpg><p id=par-10_26><a href=#>Mindy has been traveling</a> and showing off her fitness skills. Zach has been busy owning his workout brand, Casual Athlete, as he furthers his fitness brand.</p><h2 id=h-brandon-reid-and-taylor-dunklin>Brandon Reid and Taylor Dunklin</h2><p id=par-11_56>No relationship was more doomed than Brandon and Taylor. Fans were quick to dislike either one of them, calling one or the other the enemy of the relationship. Brandon was said to be uncooperative with the production crew. Reports surfaced that <a href=#>Taylor was a last-minute addition</a> to the show because two other potential brides backed out.</p><p id=par-12_41>It looks like the third time was not a charm. Brandon has disappeared from sight and isn’t on social media at all. Taylor has been living the good life, including taking trips to warm-weather locations and spending time with her family.</p><h2 id=h-derek-and-katie>Derek and Katie</h2><p id=par-13_49>Derek Sherman was the season’s darling for the fans. Many people wanted him to find the right woman and be happy. Unfortunately, Katie Conrad felt a little out of place on the show despite initially seemingly interested in Derek. The couple divorced before the reunion show for Season 10.</p><p id=par-14_38>Derek has been on the road and traveling a lot, visiting both major U.S. cities and other travel locales around the globe. Katie, meanwhile, is married to Brandon Eaves and is in Biloxi, Mississippi, according to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_36>New seasons of Married at First Sight continue to air on Lifetime. Can fans anticipate a better outcome for the chosen couples? Or will the fail rate continue to be the same as the current average?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6or7RopydZZGpeqe10ayrZquZnLW1edKemKynnmJ%2BcXnCqKyppJWoeri0xKucZpmimnq1tMSyZKenp2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./calvin-harris-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Calvin Harris Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pok%C3%A9mon-sleep-might-be-interesting-but-how-would-it-work-for-those-with-sleep-disorders.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pokmon Sleep might be interesting, but how would it work for those with sleep disorders?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
