He earned it through decades of dedicated service.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>In 2327, Ensign Picard graduated from Starfleet Academy top of his class. He later recalled that as a young man, he was “green as hell. And oh, so cocky.” This arrogance led to a bar fight against a bunch of Nausicaans, where he was stabbed through the heart and barely survived the subsequent emergency operation to save his life.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>After serving on a few ships, Picard, now a Lieutenant, was assigned helmsman on board the U.S.S. Stargazer and in 2333 he assumed command of the vessel when the captain was killed on the bridge. For his brave and decisive actions, Picard was awarded a field promotion to the rank of Captain and proceeded to command the Stargazer for twenty-two years.</p><h2 id=h-command-of-the-stargazer data-injectable=false>Command of the Stargazer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/download-8.png><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>During this time, the Stargazer was heavily involved in first-contact missions and violent wars with Cardassia. During one incident, the ship was facing off against a Cardassian vessel. Taking a risk, Picard lowered his shields as a gesture of goodwill only to be attacked. The Stargazer and its crew only just managed to get away with their lives.</p><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=955 data-injectable=true>In 2355, Picard’s long run as Captain of the vessel ended abruptly. In a fight with an unknown vessel, the Stargazer was crippled and about to be annihilated. Thinking fast, Picard came up with a brilliant solution. He would engage his warp drive, almost ramming the enemy ship, before opening fire at point-blank range. For a moment the Stargazer would appear to be in two places at once. Incredibly, this last gamble born out of sheer desperation worked, and the unknown vessel was destroyed. But Picard’s ship had suffered too much damage and had to be abandoned, the surviving crew escaping in pods.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>But the so-called Battle of Maxia would come back to haunt Picard in the future. The unknown vessel was in fact a Ferengi ship, and left one powerful Ferengi commander out for Picard’s blood.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Forever afterward called The Picard Maneuver, the practice of warping up to an enemy vessel and firing everything would be seen more than once in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Star Trek</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKygmaV6pbXDZpqaqKSWtq95z6KamqqUYrOqvtKtZJynnaKur7CMoqVmq6SWv27A0Z6iaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-the-firefly-camp-in-hbo-s-the-last-of-us.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where is the Firefly camp in HBOs The Last of Us?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./monaleo-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Monaleo Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
