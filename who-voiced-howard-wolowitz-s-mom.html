Prior to The Big Bang Theory, Susi was most known for her role as Monique Marmelstein on ABC’s The Night Stalker.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_44>The actor appeared in a number of other series, including Cheers, Doogie Howser, M.D., and Six Feet Under. On the Season 3 <a href=#>episode of Seinfeld</a>, “The Boyfriend,”&nbsp; George (Jason Alexander) goes on a date with Susi’s character after her unemployment officer father busts him.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Susi died in 2014&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_41>Susi died of cancer in Los Angeles in 2014 at the age of 62. The Big Bang Theory was heading into <a href=#>its eighth season</a> when the tragic news hit. And the entire cast and crew shared their heartbreak over the loss.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_65>“Unseen by viewers, the Mrs. Wolowitz’s character became a bit of a mystery throughout the show’s eight seasons,” showrunners wrote in a statement at the time. “What was not a mystery, however, was Carol Ann’s immense talent and comedic timing, which were on display during each unforgettable appearance. In addition to her talent, Carol Ann was a constant source of joy and kindness to all.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_39>Cast members like Melisssa Rauch and Mayim Bialik shared kind words for Susi on Twitter. “So grateful to have known Carol Ann Susi who brought laughter & light with her always,” <a href=#>Rauch tweeted</a>. “She’ll forever be in my heart.”</p><p id=par-7_21>After Susi’s death, The Big Bang Theory writers paid tribute to her on the Nov. 13, 2014 episode, The Septum Deviation.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘The Big Bang Theory’ star didn’t mind being unseen</h2><p id=par-8_56>In a 2013 interview with <a href=#>Cleveland</a>, Susi revealed how showrunner Chuck Lorre described the role to her when she joined The Big Bang Theory&nbsp; as Mrs. Wolowitz in season 1. She said he told her it would be similar to the Carlton the Doorman character from Rhoda, where she would only be heard and not seen.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_31>“[Lorre] said, ‘You don’t mind not seeing the hair and makeup people for the next 10 years?’ And I said, ‘Not at all, as long as I get paid,’” Susi explained.</p><p id=par-10_32>All of her co-stars were in the spotlight, but Susi didn’t mind remaining unseen to the audience. “It didn’t bother me that they’d never show Howard’s mother,” Susi told the outlet.</p><p id=par-11_37>“I absolutely didn’t care. A job’s a job. You just go in wanting to get the job, so I read for the casting director. They called me back. I read for the producers, and that was it.”</p><p id=par-12_52>When she first took on the role of Howard’s mom, Susi wasn’t sure exactly how to play it. “It just hit me that they wanted someone who was screaming at him all the time, so that’s what I did,” she revealed. “It’s a great job. Are you kidding? I have a ball.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm6CgZZKWu6h506GcqKqpYsSpu4yvpqKblZl6qbvWmqmdZaekubDDyK2xrGWdpLpvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-in-death-books-in-order.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All In Death books in order</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-we-re-hoping-for-in-season-4.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Were Hoping for in Season 4</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
