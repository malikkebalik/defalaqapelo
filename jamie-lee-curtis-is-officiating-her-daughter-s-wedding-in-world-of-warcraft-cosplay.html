The 63-year-old actress expressed excitement for officiating and attending a cosplay wedding, wherein attendees dress up as various characters from films, television shows, video games, comic books, and more.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Curtis shared details about her daughter Ruby’s wedding setting, which will be close to home in her very own backyard. She mentioned that after Ruby becomes a newlywed, both of her children will have married in her backyard, which is any mother’s dream. Curtis added that the wedding would be special because it would be in a more intimate environment than a traditional venue — away from flashing cameras and prying eyes.</p><p>“I am officiating in May. It is a cosplay wedding. That means you wear a costume, you dress up as something. Everybody at the wedding is going to be in costume and I will be in a costume to officiate the wedding…It’s not a theme, it’s a cosplay wedding. It’s really exciting, We’re gonna have a beautiful picnic in the backyard. I’m really excited. Both my children will have been married in my backyard, which brings me to tears….It’s so much more meaningful. Just forgetting all of show-off business – being a parent, having both of your children married in your backyard.”</p>Jamie Lee Curtis via Jimmy Kimmel Live<p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Curtis went on to explain that her cosplay costume would be inspired by Jaina Proudmoore, a humanoid sorceress from the World of Warcraft role-playing game. She exchanged communication with an Etsy seller regarding an accurate replica costume, but was disheartened to discover that the shipment would be delayed due to a supply and demand issue in Russia, the origin country. She told Kimmel that the delay was expected to be longer than a week or two, cutting it close to the wedding date in May.</p><p>“(They) picked my costume, which her name is Jaina Proudmoore. She’s an admiral. So I went on Etsy and wrote ‘Jaina Proudmoore costume,’ and up came a woman who had the costume. We exchanged communication, I paid her a nice sum of money for this, and all is going great, I sent her my measurements. Everything’s going great, until a month ago. I got an email from her, she said ‘There may be a delay in sending the costume,’ I said ‘Okay, that’s fine, a week or two is fine.’….The costume is coming from Russia….You know there’s a little bit of a supply chain issue going on.”</p>Jamie Lee Curtis via Jimmy Kimmel Live<p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>Fingers crossed that Curtis receives her outfit in time. If not, she always has a last resort of pulling out some old Halloween costumes. Hell, she’d make a great Laurie Strode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3ornInmSlnZVisLa%2B06KqZqGjYrynssicoJqsmaO0brTEq2SdmaWctbWx0axksJ2Umbavs4yipWavn6e5pXnOn2SwmaKYv6Ky02aaqKugoa66ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-riggins-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Riggins Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-the-cast-of-disney-s-live-action-mulan-and-who-they-re-playing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's the cast of Disney's live-action 'Mulan' and who they're playing</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-rick-and-morty-season-7-episode-titles.html>All Rick and Morty season 7 episode titles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jenelle-evans-pregnant-admits-she-is-still-drinking-alcohol-and-doing-drugs-baby-at-risk.html>Jenelle Evans Pregnant Admits She Is Still Drinking Alcohol And Doing Drugs Baby at Risk!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-fiance-deputy-officer-relationship.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Fiance: Deputy Officer Relationship</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-smith-has-the-coolest-futuristic-motorcycle-inspired-by-i-robot.html>Will Smith Has The Coolest Futuristic Motorcycle Inspired by 'I, Robot'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./days-of-our-lives-spoilers-brady-joins-kristen-on-dark-side-xander-victor-pay-for-rachel-pain.html>Days of Our Lives Spoilers: Brady Joins Kristen on Dark Side Xander &amp;amp; Victor Pay for Rachel Pain</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX.
